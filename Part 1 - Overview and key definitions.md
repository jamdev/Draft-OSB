service;

(ii) in the case of a search service, content that may be encountered
in or via search results.


(7) A user-to-user service or a search service is exempt if it is a service of a
description that is exempt as provided for by Schedule 1.


(8) The Secretary of State may by regulations amend Schedule 1 to provide for a
further description of user-to-user service or search service to be exempt, if the
Secretary of State considers that the risk of harm to individuals in the United
Kingdom presented by a service of that description is low.


(9) If the condition in subsection (10) is satisfied, the Secretary of State may by
regulations repeal any of the following—
(a) paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 (services offering only one-to-one live aural
communications);

regulations.


#### EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR THIS SECTION

Part 1: Overview and key definitions
Clause 1: Overview of Act

The first clause sets out the purpose of the various parts of the Bill.
Clause 2: Meaning of “user-to-user service” and “search service”

This clause provides definitions for the terms “user-to-user service” and “search
service”. These are the two primary types of services that may be subject to
regulatory duties.
Subsection (1) defines a user-to-user service as an internet service (see clause 133)
which allows users to generate, upload or share content which may be encountered
by others on that service. Subsection (2) makes clear that this includes content which
may be encountered by others through a functionality on the service (such as a
functionality to send a direct message). Subsection (3) states that a service with
user-generated content is a user-to-user service regardless of the proportion of user-
generated content on that service.
Subsection (4) cross-references the definitions of “content” and “encounter” in clause
137 of the Bill. For the purposes of the Bill “content” means anything communicated
by means of an internet service (as defined in clause 133), whether publicly or
privately, and “encounter” means read, view, hear or otherwise experience.
Subsection (5) sets out that a search service means an internet service that is, or
includes, a search engine (as defined in clause 134) and which is not a user-to-user
service.
Subsection (6) allows that any dissociable part of a user-to-user or search service will
be exempt from regulatory duties if that dissociable part meets the conditions to
benefit from the internal business exemption. Those conditions are set out in
Schedule 1, paragraph 4(2). This would cover, for example, an internal company
message board that is contained within a public-facing service, but protected so that
it is only accessible to the company’s employees.
Clause 3: Meaning of “regulated service” and Schedule 1: Exempt services

This clause defines the term “regulated service”. Subsections (3) and (4) set out that
a “regulated service” is a user-to-user service or search service (both of which are
defined in clause 2) which has links with the United Kingdom and is not exempt.
Subsections (5) and (6) clarify the circumstances under which the regulated service
has links with the United Kingdom. A service will only be in scope if it has a
significant number of users in the UK, if the UK is a target market, or if the service
can be used in the UK by individuals and there are reasonable grounds to believe
that there is a material risk of significant harm to individuals in the UK. As the
regulatory framework established by the Bill is focused on protecting UK users, these
subsections ensure that services which do not have UK links do not fall into scope of
regulation.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (7) provides that services meeting the descriptions set out in Schedule 1
will be out of scope of regulation. This means that the following services will be
exempt from regulatory duties: Email-only services, SMS and/or MMS-only services,
services offering only one-to-one live aural communications, internal business
services, limited functionality services and services provided by public bodies.
Subsection (8) allows the Secretary of State to make regulations which amend
Schedule 1 in order to exempt additional user-to-user services or search services.
This will provide for the Secretary of State to exempt new categories of services if the
Secretary of State considers that the risk of harm to UK users presented by those
services are low. Such categories could be based, for example, on the presence of
only specific limited functionalities on a service. This power will allow the online
safety framework to keep pace with technological and behavioural changes and to
ensure that an excessive burden is not placed on UK businesses.
The power under subsection (9) enables some exemptions listed in Schedule 1 to be
repealed, namely the exemptions for services offering one-to-one live aural
communications, limited functionality services, and any exemptions created through
the power set out in subsection (8). Exemptions can only be repealed subject to the
condition in subsection (10), which is that the Secretary of State considers it is
appropriate to do so because the category of exempt services poses a risk of harm to
individuals in the United Kingdom. For the online safety framework to function
effectively, it has to remain responsive to technological changes. Services which are
currently low-risk, and which therefore merit a complete exemption from the
framework today, may pose a higher risk of harm in the future. It is therefore
important that these services can be brought into scope of the regulatory framework
should the need arise.
Regulations can also be made to amend related provisions in Schedule 1 (see
subsection (11)) or the definitions in clause 39 (“regulated content”, “user-generated
content” and “search results"; see subsection (12)). The reason for this is that the
development of new risks will not necessarily occur uniformly across exempt services
and the functionalities they offer. It is possible that a risk could occur in relation to a
specific functionality of an exempt service but not for another (such as in relation to
comments rather than reviews). This power will mean that the entire exemption does
not have to be repealed because of a localised risk in relation to a specific part of an
exemption. This power provides the flexibility to respond to changing risks and
technological developments without requiring the full repeal of an exemption.
Regulations under this clause are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
Schedule 1

Schedule 1 sets out which services will be exempt from regulatory duties. Subsection
(7) of clause 3 (“Meaning of ‘regulated service’”) states that services of the
descriptions set out in this Schedule are exempt.
Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 explain that services will be exempt if the only type of user-
generated content enabled by the service is, respectively, email, SMS and/or MMS
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)

(as defined in clause 39(14)), or one-to-one live aural communications (as defined in
clause 39(6)).
Paragraph 4 explains what is meant by “internal business service”, and states that
such services are exempt from regulatory duties. The “internal business service”
exemption encompasses services such as business intranets, productivity and
collaboration tools, content management systems, customer relationship
management systems and database management software.
To qualify as an internal business service, the service must meet the conditions set
out in paragraph 4(2). These conditions are as follows. Firstly, the service must be an
internal resource or tool for a business, or multiple businesses carried on by the
same person. Secondly, the person carrying on the business (or businesses) must
be the provider of the service, i.e. (for user-to-user services) the entity that has
control over who can use the service and (for search services) the entity that has
control over the operations of the search engine (see clause 116(2) and (5)). Thirdly,
the service must only be available to a closed group of individuals. This may include
(i) the person carrying on the business; (ii) the business’s officers (as defined in
paragraph (4); (iii) the business’s employees or volunteers; and (iv) others who have
expressly been authorised to use the service by an individual in (i), (ii) or (iii), such as
a company contracted by the business.
Paragraph 4(3) states that an internal business search service is exempt from
regulatory duties, even if only the search engine part of the search service meets the
criteria in paragraph 4(2). A dissociable part of a user-to-user search service may
qualify for this exemption (see subsection (6) of clause 2).
Paragraph 5 sets out that, under the limited functionality services exemption, a user-
to-user service is exempt if the only functionalities enabling user-generated content
on the service are the following:
a. The posting of comment and reviews in relation to content that has been
directly posted or uploaded by the service provider or website;
b. The sharing of these comments and reviews on other internet services;
c. Expressing views on such comments and reviews either through; (i): the “like
or dislike” button, (ii): applying an emoji or symbol of any kind, (iii): engaging
in yes/no voting and (iv): rating or scoring content.
This exemption is expected primarily to exempt ‘below the line’ content on media
articles and reviews of directly provided goods and services. Any services that meet
the above requirements but have additional user-to-user functionalities will remain in
regulatory scope.
Paragraph 6 provides that some user-to-user and search services provided by
certain public bodies are exempt from regulatory duties. This exemption covers
services provided by Parliament and foreign governments, as well as services
provided by public authorities in the UK and bodies outside the UK where those
services are provided in the exercise of functions of a public nature only.


#### DELEGATED POWERS MEMORANDUM

PART 1: OVERVIEW AND KEY DEFINITIONS
Clause 3(8): Meaning of “regulated service”

Power conferred on: Secretary of State
Power exercised by: Regulations
Parliamentary procedure: Affirmative

Context and purpose

This clause defines the services in scope of this legislation. It provides that “regulated
service” means a regulated user-to-user service, or a regulated search service. To be
in scope of the regulatory framework, the service must have links with the United
Kingdom by having a significant number of users in the United Kingdom; being
targeted towards United Kingdom users; or being capable of being used by
individuals in the United Kingdom and give rise to a risk of significant harm to
individuals in the United Kingdom.
Certain user-to-user services or search services are exempted if they pose a low risk
of harm to users, or are otherwise regulated. These are set out in Schedule 1 to the
Bill (see subsection (7) of clause 3) and are:
○ Email-only services (paragraph 1 of Schedule 1);
○ SMS/MMS-only services (paragraph 2 of Schedule 1);
○ Services which offer only one-to-one live aural communications (such as a
voice-only call over IP (internet protocol)) (paragraph 3 of Schedule 1);
○ Internal business services (such as an organisation’s intranet) (paragraph 4
of Schedule 1);
○ Services which only have limited user-to-user functionalities, specifically
those which only allow users to communicate via posting of comments and
reviews relating to content produced and published by the provider of the
service (or by a person acting on behalf of the service provider), such as
user reviews of products (paragraph 5 of Schedule 1); and
○ Some services provided by certain public bodies (paragraph 6 of Schedule
1).
Subsection (8) allows the Secretary of State to make regulations which amend
Schedule 1 to provide for further descriptions of user-to-user service or search service
to be exempt. This power may be used only if the Secretary of State considers that
the risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom presented by a service of that
description to be low.
Subsection (12) further allows regulations under subsection (8) to amend clause 39,
which provides for the meaning of “regulated content”, where these changes are
connected to the addition of a new exempt service to Schedule 1.
The power in subsection (8) is a Henry VIII power in that it allows other provisions of
the Bill to be amended by secondary legislation.
Justification for the power

For the Online Safety framework to function effectively, it must remain responsive to
technological changes, and be proportionate in its application. Where there is a low
risk of harm, companies should not face a disproportionate regulatory burden.
The power conferred by subsection (8) allows the description of services exempted
from regulation, set out in Schedule 1, to be amended as new technologies and
patterns of user behaviour develop. The current list of exempt services is provided in
Schedule 1 to give OFCOM and companies certainty about which services will initially
fall outside of scope. This power allows the initial list of exempt services to be
expanded where there is evidence that other types of user-to-user or search services
present a low risk of harm.
The associated provision in subsection (12) allowing regulations made under
subsection (8) to amend clause 39 is intended to ensure consistency of approach
across the legislation following any amendment of Schedule 1. For example, it would
permit the Secretary of State to amend the definition of “regulated content” in clause
39(2) to exempt another category of content at the same time as amending Schedule
1 to exempt services which only carry that type of content.
Justification for the procedure

By virtue of clause 132(4)(a), regulations made under clause 3(8) are subject to the
affirmative procedure.
The affirmative resolution procedure is the appropriate vehicle for this power, as
functionality based exemptions will directly affect the scope of the regulatory
framework. It is important that Parliament has the opportunity to debate such changes
to the scope of the regulatory framework.
Clause 3(9) and (11): Meaning of “regulated service”

Powers conferred on: Secretary of State
Powers exercised by: Regulations
Parliamentary procedure: Affirmative

Context and purpose

As set out above (see “Clause 3 (8): Meaning of “regulated service”), subsection (7)
of clause 3 exempts specific types of user-to-user and search services from
regulation.
Clause 3(9) allows certain specific exemptions to be repealed by means of
regulations made by the Secretary of State, which would then bring such services into
scope of regulation. The exemptions which can be repealed are:
○ Services which offer only one-to-one live aural communications (such as a
voice-only call over IP (internet protocol)) (paragraph 3 of Schedule 1);
○ Services which only have limited user-to-user functionalities, specifically
those which only allow users to communicate via posting of comments and
reviews relating to content produced and published by the provider of the
service (or by a person acting on behalf of the service provider), such as
user reviews of products (paragraph 5 of Schedule 1);
○ Any exemption created through regulations made under subsection (8) of
clause 3.
The power to repeal an exemption can only be used if the Secretary of State
considers that it is appropriate to do so because of the risk of harm to individuals in
the United Kingdom presented by the type of exempt service. For example, there may
be evidence of an increased risk of harm from such types of service. This is set out in
subsection (10).
Subsection (12) allows regulations under subsection (9) to amend clause 39. So, for
example, amendments can be made to the meanings of “regulated content”,
“comments and reviews on provider content” and “one-to-one live aural
communications”, where these changes are connected to the repeal of one of the
specific exempt services from Schedule 1.
Subsection (11) contains a separate power to amend (as opposed to repeal) those
provisions in Schedule 1 which are referred to in subsection (9) (i.e. the exemptions
for services offering only live one-to-one aural communications and for limited
functionality services, and any new exemptions added by regulations made under the
subsection (8) power).
The powers in subsection (9) and (11) are Henry VIII powers in that they allow
provisions in the Bill to be amended by secondary legislation.
Justification for the powers

For the Online Safety framework to function effectively, it has to remain responsive to
technological changes. Services which are currently low-risk, and which therefore
merit a complete exemption from the framework today, may pose a higher risk of
harm in the future. This is particularly important as harm can migrate quickly across
different types of services. It is important that, should the level of risk from exempt
services rise to the point where an exemption is no longer merited, those services can
be brought into scope of the regulatory framework or amended.
Importantly, the power to repeal exemptions can only be exercised if the Secretary of
State considers that that is appropriate because of the risk of harm to individuals in
the United Kingdom presented by a service of the description in question (see
subsection (10)).
Under subsection (8) of clause 3, the Secretary of State can also exempt other types
of services from the scope of regulation, if the Secretary of State considers such
services to pose a low risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom. The level of
risk on such types of services may also increase over time. Such exemptions should
therefore be repealable or amendable to reflect changing levels of risk of harm to
individuals in the United Kingdom.
The government has worked to identify areas where future changes in user behaviour
could necessitate the repeal or amendment of exemptions in Schedule 1. It is creating
this limited and targeted power to repeal only certain exemptions on this basis;
specifically, this power will allow the Secretary of State to make regulations repealing
or amending exemptions which apply to one-to-one live aural communications, to
limited functionality services, and to any new exemptions created by regulations
made under subsection (8) of clause 3.
The associated provision in subsection (12) allowing regulations made under
subsections (9) and (11) to amend relevant provisions of Schedule 1 and clause 39
enables consequential changes to be made to ensure consistency of approach
across the Bill.
Justification for the procedure

By virtue of clause 132(4)(a), regulations made under clause 3(9) and (11) are
subject to the affirmative procedure.
The affirmative resolution procedure is the appropriate vehicle for these powers, as
functionality based exemptions will directly affect the scope of the regulatory
framework. Removing or amending any exemptions could increase regulatory
burdens on businesses, in particular businesses providing services who had
previously benefited from the exemption. It is important that Parliament has the
opportunity to debate such changes to the scope of the regulatory framework.
