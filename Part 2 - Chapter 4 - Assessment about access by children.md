#### CHAPTER 4

#### ASSESSMENT ABOUT ACCESS BY CHILDREN

**26 Assessment about access by children**


(1) A provider of a regulated service must, at a time set out in section 27, carry out
an assessment—
(a) to determine whether it is possible for children to access the service or
any part of the service, and
(b) if it is possible for children to access the service or any part of the
service, to determine whether the child user condition is met in relation
to the service or any part of the service.


(2) If a provider provides more than one regulated service, an assessment under
subsection (1) must be carried out for each service separately.


(3) A provider is only entitled to conclude that it is not possible for children to
access a service, or a part of it, if there are systems or processes in place that


achieve the result that children are not normally able to access the service or
that part of it.


(4) The “child user condition” is met in relation to a service, or a part of a service,
if—
(a) there are a significant number of children who are users of the service
or of that part of it, or
(b) the service, or that part of it, is of a kind likely to attract a significant
number of users who are children.

#### DELEGATED POWERS MEMORANDUM

CHAPTER 4: ASSESSMENT ABOUT ACCESS BY CHILDREN
Clause 28(1): OFCOM’s guidance about assessments under section 26

Power conferred on: OFCOM
Power exercised by: Guidance
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

Clause 26 imposes a statutory duty on a provider of a regulated service to carry out
an assessment as to whether it is possible for children to access a service, or any
part of its service. A provider can only conclude that it is not possible for a child to
access its service if it has robust systems or processes in place which result in
children not normally being able to access the service. These could be effective age-
verification measures or an equivalent technology which identifies and prevents
children accessing the service.
If it is possible for children to access the service, then the provider will have to go on
to assess whether there are children who use the service, or if the service is of a kind
likely to attract users who are children. This would apply both to services designed to
be accessed by children, and services intended for an adult-only audience but which
evidence shows children are accessing (for example, pornography sites). If the
answer to that question is yes, then the provider’s services will be treated as likely to
be accessed by children and have to comply with the safety duties protecting
children. Failure to carry out an assessment would also result in the provider’s
service being treated as likely to be accessed by children until an assessment is
carried out.
Clause 28 imposes a duty on OFCOM to prepare and publish guidance for providers
of regulated services to assist them in complying with their duties to carry out
assessments on children’s access. The clause also gives OFCOM power to revise
the guidance.
Justification for the power

OFCOM’s power to publish guidance will allow it to set out in detail how companies
can assess the extent to which their services are likely to be accessed by children. It
would be inappropriate to set out such detailed content on the face of the legislation.
The power to revise this document provides the flexibility to modify the details quickly
if changes are required.
Justification for the procedure

Since these provisions are concerned with operational and administrative matters in
the context of the duty imposed on regulated providers under clause 26, the provision
to be made is administrative rather than legislative in character, and no Parliamentary
procedure is considered necessary.




(5) For the purposes of this Part, a service is to be treated as “likely to be accessed
by children” if the provider’s assessment of the service concludes that—
(a) it is possible for children to access the service or any part of it, and
(b) the child user condition is met in relation to—
(i) the service, or
(ii) a part of the service that it is possible for children to access.


(6) If a service is not treated as “likely to be accessed by children” for the purposes
of this Part, the provider must carry out a further assessment under this
section—
(a) before making any significant change to any aspect of the design or
operation of the service,
(b) in response to evidence about reduced effectiveness of any systems or
processes that are in place as mentioned in subsection (3), or
(c) in response to evidence about a significant increase in the number of
children using the service.


(7) A provider must keep written records of every assessment under this section.


(8) If a provider fails to carry out an assessment of a service as required by this
section, that service is to be treated as “likely to be accessed by children” for the
purposes of this Part until such time as the provider carries out an assessment.


(9) For the purposes of subsection (4)—
(a) the reference to a “significant” number includes a reference to a number
which is significant in proportion to the total number of United
Kingdom users of a service or (as the case may be) a part of a service;
(b) whether the test in paragraph (a) of that subsection is met is to be based
on evidence about who actually uses a service, rather than who the
intended users of the service are.


(10) In this section references to children are to children in the United Kingdom.

**27 Timing of assessment under section 26**


(1) In the case of a regulated service which is in operation immediately before the
day on which OFCOM first publish guidance under section 28, an assessment
must be carried out within the period of three months beginning with that day,
unless extra time is allowed by agreement with OFCOM.


(2) In the case of a regulated service which begins operating on or after the day
referred to in subsection (1), an assessment must be carried out before United
Kingdom users are able to access the service.

(3) In the case of a user-to-user service or search service which, having previously
not been a regulated service, becomes a regulated service, an assessment must
be carried out—
(a) before United Kingdom users are able to access the service, or
(b) if such users were already able to access the service, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the service becomes a regulated service.


(4) In this section “assessment” means an assessment under section 26(1).


(5) In its application to a service not yet accessed by United Kingdom users,
section 26 is to be read with the necessary modifications.

**28 OFCOM’s guidance about assessments under section 26**


(1) OFCOM must prepare guidance for providers of regulated services to assist
them in complying with their duties to carry out assessments under section 26.


(2) OFCOM must publish the guidance (and any revised or replacement
guidance).

#### EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR THIS SECTION

Chapter 4: Assessment about access by children

Clause 26: Assessment about access by children

This clause establishes a requirement for providers of regulated services to
conduct an assessment of whether children are likely to access their service. This is
a key requirement of the safety duties to be imposed on all providers of regulated
services in relation to children, as set out in clauses 10 and 22 (safety duties for
services likely to be accessed by children).
Under subsection (1), the assessment must determine first, whether it is
possible for children to access the service (or any part of it) and second, if so,
whether (i) there are, in fact, a significant number of children who are users of the
service or (ii) the service is of a kind likely to attract a significant number of users who
are children. The second part of this assessment is known in the Bill as ‘the child

user condition’: see subsection (4). Subsection (9) provides more information about
how the ‘child user condition’ is to be met.
Where a provider has more than one service, then an individual assessment
as to whether it is likely to be accessed by children must be carried out for each
service separately: subsection (2). For example, if a technology platform provides
services which can be publicly accessible (e.g. public profiles) but also private (e.g.
private messaging), two separate assessments will need to be conducted on the
likelihood of children accessing each of these services.
Subsection (3) provides that a provider is only able to conclude that it is not
possible for a child to access a service (or part of it), if there are robust systems and
processes, such as effective age verification measures, in place that ensure that
children are not normally able to access the service. Age verification refers to the age
assurance measures that provide the highest level of confidence about a user’s age.
For example, where a regulated service hosts both user-generated content (which
would be regulated content) and non-user generated content (which would not be
regulated content), and its child users are only able to access the latter (e.g. a simple
online game with age-gated messaging functionalities), then the provider would be
able to conclude that its service is not likely to be accessed by children.
Subsection (5) provides that a service is to be ‘treated as likely to be
accessed by children’ where the provider’s assessment concludes that first, it is
possible for children to access the service (or any part of it) and second, that either a
significant number of children are using the service (or that particular part of it) or the
service is likely to attract a significant number of users who are children (for example,
if the design, functionality and content of the service is appealing to children).
Subsection (6) specifies that providers of services which are not ‘likely to be
accessed by children’ must keep the assessment of children’s access under review
and complete a further assessment in three circumstances:
a. before making significant changes to the way their service functions (for
example, if a new feature is introduced which may appeal to children);
b. where they are made aware of any issues with the effectiveness of their
systems and processes for ensuring that children are not normally able to
access the service;
c. where there is evidence of a significant increase in the number of children
using the service.
Subsection (7) requires providers to keep written records of every
assessment prepared in accordance with this clause, and subsection (8) provides
that if a provider fails to carry out such an assessment, then that service will be
treated as ‘likely to be accessed by children’ until such time as the provider carries
out an assessment. Accordingly, the safety duties imposed on providers in relation to
children will apply.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (9) provides more information about how the ‘child user condition’
is to be met. It establishes that for the purposes of the ‘child user condition’ a
‘significant’ number should be considered as such where it is significant in proportion
to the total number of United Kingdom users of a service or (as the case may be) a
part of a service. It also sets out that the ‘child user condition’ should be based on
evidence about who actually uses a service, rather than who the intended users of
the service are.
Subsection (10) is self-explanatory.
Clause 27: Timing of assessment under section 26

Subsection (1) requires existing regulated service providers to carry out their
first assessment of whether children are likely to access their service within three
months from the date OFCOM’s guidance on making this assessment (see clause
28) is first published, unless agreed otherwise with OFCOM.
Subsection (2) requires providers of new user-to-user services or search
services which start operating on or after the date referred to above, to carry out an
assessment of whether children are likely to access the service before UK users are
able to access the service. For user-to-user services or search services which
become regulated services, an assessment must be carried out before users are
able to access the service or, where UK users were already able to access the
service, as soon as reasonably practicable after the service becomes a regulated
service: see subsection (3).
Subsections (4) and (5) are self-explanatory
Clause 28: OFCOM’s guidance about assessments under section 26

This clause will require OFCOM to produce and publish guidance for
providers of services on how to make an assessment as to whether children are
likely to access their services.
