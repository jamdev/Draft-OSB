#### EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR THIS SECTION

Part 3: Other Duties of Service Providers
Chapter 1: Transparency Reports

Clause 49: Transparency reports by service providers

This clause requires providers of relevant services to publish annual
transparency reports and sets out OFCOM’s powers in relation to these reports. The
information set out in transparency reports will help ensure that users are able to
understand the steps providers are taking to keep them safe, and will furnish
OFCOM with the information required to hold them to account where needed.
Subsection (1) requires providers of relevant services to produce annual
transparency reports. This report must contain the information of a kind specified by
OFCOM in a notice given to the provider, in the format specified by OFCOM, and
must be submitted by a date specified by OFCOM and published in the manner and
by the deadline given by OFCOM.
Subsection (2) requires providers of relevant services to ensure that the
information in their transparency reports is complete and accurate.
Subsection (3) provides that only Category 1, Category 2A and Category 2B
services will be classified as “relevant services”, and thus only providers of these
services will be required to produce annual transparency reports. The subsection
also signposts to clause 59(6) for more information on the definitions of Category 1,
Category 2A and Category 2B services.
Subsection (4) specifies the types of information that OFCOM will be able to
require providers of relevant services to include in their transparency reports. This
could include, for example, information about the incidence of harmful content on a
provider’s service and the processes enabling users to report such content. The
subsection describes high-level types of information in order to allow OFCOM the
flexibility to tailor the exact information it will require to the relevant service in
question. Moreover, in order to ensure that the types of information that can be
required remain relevant to a fast-changing online safety landscape, subsection (7)
permits the Secretary of State, having consulted OFCOM, to amend the types of
information listed in subsection (4) by regulations.
Subsection (5) sets out various factors that OFCOM must take into account
when deciding which types of information to require under subsection (4). These
include the service provider’s capacity to produce information, the type of service and
the functionalities the service offers, the number of UK users of the service and the
proportion of UK users who are children. These factors are designed to help OFCOM
to select the most appropriate and proportionate types of information to require from
the service provider in question
Subsection (6) grants the Secretary of State the power to change (via
regulations) the frequency with which providers of relevant services are required to
produce transparency reports. The Secretary of State must consult OFCOM before
making regulations under this subsection (subsection (8)).
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (7) grants the Secretary of State the power to change (via
regulations) the kinds of information that OFCOM can require a provider of a relevant
service to include in its transparency report under subsection (4), and the factors that
OFCOM must take into account under subsection (5) in deciding which kinds of
information to require. The Secretary of State must consult OFCOM before making
regulations under this subsection (subsection (8)).
Subsection (9) signposts to the meanings of the terms “content that is harmful
to adults”, “content that is harmful to children” and “illegal content”.
Clause 50: Transparency reports: guidance

This clause places a requirement on OFCOM to prepare guidance on how it
will exercise its powers relating to transparency reports (clause 49) and to consult on
and publish this guidance.
Subsection (1) places a duty on OFCOM to prepare guidance detailing, for
example, how it will decide what types of information (from the list in clause 49(4)) it
will require providers of relevant services to include in their transparency reports,
describing how information from provider’s transparency reports will be used in
drawing up OFCOM’s transparency report, and anything else that OFCOM deems
relevant to the production and publication of providers’ transparency reports and its
own transparency report.
Subsection (2) sets out a list of people whom OFCOM must consult before
preparing guidance, if OFCOM considers it appropriate to consult that person.
Subsection (3) requires OFCOM to publish the first version of the guidance,
as well as any later versions of the guidance.
Subsection (4) says that in exercising its functions under section 49 or 100,
OFCOM must have regard to the guidance for the time being in force under this
section.
Subsection (5) notes that the term “relevant service” means the same thing in
this clause as it does in clause 49.
Chapter 2: Fees

Clause 51: Duty to notify OFCOM

This clause specifies that providers with qualifying worldwide revenue at or
above a specified threshold will have an obligation to notify OFCOM and pay an
annual fee, as described in clause 52. Where providers whose qualifying worldwide
revenue is at or above the threshold do not notify or pay a fee, then enforcement
action may be taken against them as provided for in clauses 88 and 89.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (1) specifies that a provider must notify OFCOM for the first
charging year that the provider is required to pay a fee. This may be the initial
charging year or a subsequent charging year. The provider must also notify OFCOM
where they believe they are no longer liable to pay a fee.
Subsection (2) clarifies that a “fee paying year’’ for a provider means a
charging year where the provider is not exempt from paying a fee, and where their
qualifying worldwide revenue for the relevant time period is at, or above, the
threshold set by OFCOM for that year.
Subsection (3) specifies that at the point of notification, the provider must
share with OFCOM:
a. details of the regulated service(s) they provide;
b. its qualifying worldwide revenue for the relevant time period; and
c. any other relevant information requested by OFCOM and specified in
OFCOM’s Statement of Charging Principles (i.e. the document issued
annually by OFCOM which includes key information on how funding is
allocated to OFCOM itself and what principles are followed in determining
fees to be charged): see clause 55.
Subsection (4) clarifies that providers will need to notify OFCOM within
timeframes detailed in OFCOM’s Statement of Charging Principles.
Subsection (5) allows for OFCOM to exempt particular descriptions of
providers from these notification requirements and the duty to pay a fee as described
in clause 52. The exemption must be approved by the Secretary of State.
Subsection (6) allows for OFCOM to revoke any exemption specified in
subsection (5), as long as the revocation has been approved by the Secretary of
State.
Subsection (7) requires that OFCOM must publish details of any exemption
approved under subsection (5).
Subsection (8) gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations to
define “qualifying worldwide review” and “qualifying period”.
Subsection (9) requires that the Secretary of State consult OFCOM before
making the regulations under subsection (8).
Subsection (10) clarifies that for the purposes of notification and payment of
an annual fee, a “provider of a regulated service” can include providers who have
been providing a service for either the entire year, or part of the year.
Subsection (11) defines “charging year’’ and “initial charging year’’.
Clause 52: Duty to pay fees

These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
This clause sets out the factors taken into account by OFCOM when
determining which regulated services are required to pay the fee, and the level of the
fee to be paid.
Subsection (1) enables OFCOM to charge a fee to providers of a regulated
service so long as the provider is not exempt and the provider’s qualifying worldwide
revenue is at or above the specified threshold.
Subsection (2) details the factors taken into account when determining the fee
payable by a regulated service provider. OFCOM will set the fee payable by a
provider taking into account the qualifying worldwide revenue for the charging year
and any other factors deemed appropriate.
Subsection (3) clarifies that in the event of a disagreement between OFCOM
and the provider, OFCOM shall determine the fee (or instalment) payable and/or the
qualifying worldwide revenue attributable to the relevant period.
Subsection (4) references the requirement for OFCOM to determine the fees
payable in line with their Statement of Charging Principles: see clause 55.
Subsection (5) clarifies that, should a provider only be in scope for part of the
charging year, OFCOM has the power to refund all or part of the fee paid by that
provider.
Subsection (6) is self-explanatory and states that “charging year’’, ‘’fee-paying
year’’, “qualifying period’’, and “qualifying worldwide revenue’’ have the same
meaning as under clause 51.
Clause 53: Threshold figure

This clause details the process to be followed when determining the threshold
at, or above which, providers will be required to notify and pay an annual fee (see
clauses 51 and 52).
Subsection (1) specifies that OFCOM must determine the appropriate
threshold figure. First, OFCOM must propose a figure to the Secretary of State: see
subsection (2).
Then, the Secretary of State must decide whether or not to approve the
proposed threshold figure put forward by OFCOM: see subsection (3).
If the Secretary of State approves the threshold figure for fees, they must
inform OFCOM and OFCOM must then publish the threshold figure: see subsection
(3). If the Secretary of State does not approve the threshold figure for fees, they must
inform OFCOM and then the Secretary of State must determine, and subsequently
publish, a threshold figure that they consider appropriate: see subsection (4).
Subsection (5) requires OFCOM to keep the threshold figure under review. If
OFCOM considers that the figure should be amended, the steps set out under
subsections (1)-(4) of this clause will need to be undertaken again.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (6) requires the first threshold figure to be published prior to the
start of the initial charging year when fees become payable.
Subsection (7) defines “initial charging year”.
Clause 54: Secretary of State’s guidance

This clause sets out the requirement for the Secretary of State to issue
guidance relating to fees and the threshold.
Subsection (1) references the requirement for the Secretary of State to issue
guidance to OFCOM setting out principles to be considered when determining fees
payable under clause 52. The guidance must also set out the principles to be
considered by OFCOM when determining the threshold figure under clause 53. The
Secretary of State must lay the guidance before Parliament (see subsection (4)) and
publish it: see subsection (5).
Before issuing, revising or replacing the fees and threshold guidance, the
Secretary of State must consult OFCOM: see subsection (2). The guidance may not
be revised or replaced more frequently than once every three years unless this is
agreed by the Secretary of State and OFCOM or it needs to be corrected as a result
of subsequent changes to the fee provisions in the Bill: subsection (3).
Subsection (6) states that OFCOM is required to have regard to the fees
guidance when exercising its functions relating to fees under this Chapter.
Clause 55: Fees statements by OFCOM

This clause details the process for OFCOM to publish a Statement of
Charging Principles. This clause covers the information that should be included in the
Statement, how OFCOM must make or amend the Statement, and how OFCOM
should make interested persons aware of the Statement.
Subsection (1) requires OFCOM to publish a Statement of Charging
Principles outlining the principles which OFCOM will adhere to when setting the fees
payable. Without publication of this document OFCOM is not permitted to require
providers to pay a fee.
Subsection (2) sets out the content of OFCOM’s Statement of Charging
Principles. This Statement must outline how the fees charged by OFCOM will meet,
but not exceed, the costs of carrying out online safety functions. It must also set out
how the fees to be charged to providers are proportionate and justifiable and that
there is transparency in relation to the costs incurred and fees charged.
Subsection (3) outlines a requirement for the Statement of Charging
Principles to include detail on how fees payable under clause 52 are calculated.
Subsection (4) sets out a requirement for OFCOM to consult those likely to be
affected by the Statement of Charging Principles prior to making or revising the
Statement. Those likely to be consulted will include providers with services in scope
of the framework.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)

Subsection (5) sets out the requirement for OFCOM to bring the Statement of
Charging Principles to the attention of those likely to be affected by it by publishing
the Statement in such a way as it considers appropriate.
Subsection (6) explains that after the end of each charging year, OFCOM
must publish a document which sets out: the total amounts of the fees payable that
were received by OFCOM; the total amount of fees that remain outstanding; and
OFCOM’s total costs of carrying out its online safety functions.
Subsection (7) sets out the requirement for any deficit or surplus identified
under subsection (6) to be carried forward and taken into account when determining
the fees payable for the following year.
Subsection (8) clarifies that “OFCOM’s costs” include costs incurred by
OFCOM in preparing to carry out their online safety functions during a charging year.
Subsection (8)(b) clarifies that “OFCOM’s costs” also include preparatory costs
incurred after clause 55 comes into force but before the initial charging year. Those
costs incurred when preparing to carry out the online safety functions, after clause 55
comes into force, should be treated as if they were incurred in the initial charging
year.
Subsection (9) states that “charging year” has the same meaning as that in
clause 51.

from all service providers which meet threshold conditions set out in regulations made
under paragraph 1 of Schedule 4.
The reports will be required following a notice from OFCOM which will set out
requirements regarding the type of information, the format in which it must be
presented and when it must be submitted. OFCOM may only request information of a
type set out in subsection (4). This includes, for example, incidences of illegal or
harmful content on the service, how many users are assumed to have encountered it
and how such content is disseminated by the service.
In deciding what information to require, OFCOM must also take account of the service
provider’s capacity to produce information, what type of service it is, its functionalities,
its number of users and the proportion of users who are children (subsection (5)). It is
conceivable that as providers develop their transparency reporting capability, more
frequent reporting may be both proportionate and useful. As such, it is essential that
the amount of time between reports can be amended. Clause 49(6) therefore enables
the Secretary of State to change the frequency with which transparency reports must
be produced.
The initial requirements on providers to produce annual reports will be placed in
primary legislation. The power to amend the frequency of transparency reports will
ensure that this provision does not become outdated. This will provide future flexibility
and ensure that the transparency framework can keep pace with changes in the
technological and regulatory landscape. Where information is needed on a more - or
less - frequent basis than is currently foreseeable, this power will allow the Secretary
of State to respond to those changes.
Justification for the power

A power to amend the required frequency of transparency reports through secondary
legislation will deliver increased flexibility, in particular if more frequent reports are
necessary.
This will ensure the transparency reporting process is responsive to technological
change, changes in people’s use of regulated services, and trends related to online
harms.
Justification for the procedure

The negative procedure is considered appropriate, as the power does not change the
substance of the requirement set out in primary legislation, just the frequency. As
such, this provides a suitable degree of Parliamentary oversight while ensuring that
the frequency of the reports can readily be kept up to date.
Clause 49(7): Transparency reports by service providers

Power conferred on: Secretary of State
Power exercised by: Regulations
Parliamentary procedure: Negative

Context and purpose

As noted above, certain categories of service providers must produce an annual
report (a ‘transparency report’) containing information of a kind and in a format
specified in a notice by OFCOM. OFCOM will only be able to require an annual
transparency report in respect of the information listed under clause 49(4). In
determining the specific information particular providers will need to report on,
OFCOM will also need to consider a range of factors, set out under clause 49(5).
Clause 49(7) allows the Secretary of State to add, vary or remove the kinds of
information listed under clause 49(4) by regulations. It also allows the Secretary of
State to update the factors OFCOM must consider in deciding what a particular
service will be required to report on in connection with any amendment to clause
49(4), by also amending the list under clause 49(5). This will ensure that the
transparency framework can respond to technological developments and changes in
usage patterns. Such reporting by regulated bodies is a common feature of similar
frameworks. This is a Henry VIII power.
Justification for the power

The power to amend clause 49(4) to add, vary or remove the list of types of
information which OFCOM can require regulated providers to report on and to amend
the factors OFCOM must take into account in deciding which kinds of information to
require (in connection with any such amendment), will futureproof the transparency
reporting framework. It will ensure that OFCOM can require companies to report on
the information which is most useful which may develop and change over time.
There may be certain kinds of information which companies should be required to
report on in the longer term, which would be difficult to foresee prior to the framework
coming into force. This power will allow the Secretary to State to update the
framework accordingly. The power will also ensure that the regime can respond to the
emergence of new technologies and changing patterns in user behaviour.
Justification for the procedure

The negative procedure is considered appropriate, as the purpose of this provision is
the limited one of updating and refining the lists of kinds of information OFCOM can
describe in notices relating to transparency reports set out in the primary legislation,
which Parliament will have had the opportunity to scrutinise and debate during the
passage of the Bill. As such, this provides a suitable degree of Parliamentary
oversight while ensuring that the specific content which OFCOM can require to be
included in the reports can readily be kept up to date.
Clause 50(1): Transparency reports: guidance

Power conferred on: OFCOM
Power exercised by: Guidance
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

Relevant services must provide annual transparency reports under clause 49. The
information to be included within those reports will be set out in notices provided by
OFCOM.
OFCOM must prepare and publish guidance on any matter they consider to be
relevant to providers producing and publishing a transparency report. The guidance
must detail how OFCOM will determine the descriptions of information in clause 49
that they will require a transparency report to contain. It must also detail how OFCOM
will take into account the provider’s capacity to produce information, its kind of
service, its functionalities, and its number of users before deciding what information to
require as well as the steps that OFCOM will take to engage with relevant providers,
before requiring the information in a notice under clause 49.
OFCOM will also have the power to revise and replace any such guidance. Before
preparing any guidance under this clause, OFCOM must consult any person they
consider appropriate including persons listed in clause 50(2) such as regulated
providers, trade associations and other regulators etc.
Justification for the power

This provision is concerned with administrative and operational matters. As the
requirements will need to be tailored to different types of service providers, it is not
appropriate to place this level of detailed content on the face of this legislation.
Delegating this power gives OFCOM the flexibility needed to consult with relevant
persons and will enable them to determine what information to require providers to
prepare a transparency report on.
Justification for the procedure

Since these provisions are concerned with operational and administrative matters, no
Parliamentary procedure is considered necessary.
CHAPTER 2: FEES
Clause 51(5): Duty to notify OFCOM

Power conferred on: OFCOM
Power exercised by: Decision subject to Secretary of State’s approval
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

OFCOM will have a power to charge an annual fee to the providers of regulated
services who are not exempt (see clause 52), where the providers meet the relevant
financial threshold (which is to be set by OFCOM and approved by the Secretary of
State, see clause 53).
Under clause 51(1), a provider of a regulated service must notify OFCOM in relation
to a charging year which is:
○ The first fee-paying year in relation to that provider, or
○ Any charging year after the first fee-paying year where—
■ The previous charging year was not a fee-paying year in relation to
the provider, and the charging year in question is a fee-paying year in
relation to the provider, or
■ The previous charging year was a fee-paying year in relation to the
provider, and the charging year in question is not a fee-paying year in
relation to the provider.
A “fee-paying year”, in relation to a provider, means a charging year where the
provider is not exempt (see subsection (5)) and the provider’s qualifying worldwide
revenue, for the qualifying period, is equal to or greater than the threshold figure. The
threshold figure in question is that which is published in accordance with clause 53.
A notification under subsection (1) must include details of all regulated services
provided by the provider. Where it is a notification under subsection (1)(a) or (b)(i), it
must also include details of the provider’s qualifying worldwide revenue for the
qualifying period that relates to that charging year, and any supporting evidence,
documents or other information specified by OFCOM in a Statement of Charging
Principles (see clause 55).
A notification under subsection (1) must be provided to OFCOM by the time specified
by OFCOM in a statement of charging principles (see clause 55).
However, these duties are extensive and may prove to be excessive in specific
cases. Under subsection (5), where OFCOM considers that an exemption from the
requirements to notify and pay a fee for such providers is appropriate, and the
Secretary of State approves the exemption, OFCOM may provide that particular
descriptions of providers of regulated services are exempt for the purposes of this
section and clause 52.
Clause 51 further allows OFCOM to revoke such an exemption where they consider
that it is no longer appropriate and the Secretary of State approves the revocation.
OFCOM must publish details of any exemption for the time being approved under
subsection (5).
Justification for the power

Providing OFCOM with the power to make exemptions from the notification and fee
requirement will allow OFCOM to remain responsive to the services which it regulates
and avoid imposing an undue regulatory burden.
Delegating this power will allow exemptions to be provided when the framework is
operational, and OFCOM can use its full resources and expertise to assess what
expectations are proportionate for particular services to comply with.
The power to provide exemptions from the notification and fee requirements is a
limited and specific power which can only be exercised with the approval of the
Secretary of State.
Justification for the procedure

Since these provisions are concerned with operational matters in the context of how
the regulator intends to use its powers, the provision to be made is administrative
rather than legislative in character. Therefore no Parliamentary procedure is
considered necessary.
However, OFCOM must receive the approval of the Secretary of State to exercise this
power. This will ensure that the Secretary of State has oversight of any exemptions.
OFCOM must also publish details of any exemption for the time being approved
under subsection (5).
Clause 51(8): Duty to notify OFCOM

Power conferred on: Secretary of State
Power exercised by: Regulations
Parliamentary procedure: Affirmative

Context and purpose

As above, OFCOM will have a power to charge an annual fee to the providers of
regulated services which are not exempt (see clause 52), where the providers meet
the relevant financial threshold (which is to be set by OFCOM and approved by the
Secretary of State (clause 53).
There will be a requirement for all providers of regulated services who meet the
financial threshold to notify OFCOM of details of the regulated services they provide,
the provider's qualifying worldwide revenue and any supporting evidence, documents
or other information specified by OFCOM in its Statement of Charging Principles
(clause 55). The notification must be provided to OFCOM within the timeframe
specified by OFCOM in its Statement of Charging Principles.
Providers will also be required to notify OFCOM if, due to a change in their qualifying
worldwide revenue, they are no longer liable to pay a fee. OFCOM will require
providers to share information as necessary to evidence this.
OFCOM has the discretion to determine the amount of the annual fee with reference
to various relevant factors (clause 52), but must do so in accordance with its
published Statement of Charging Principles. Among other things, the Statement will
include the principles that the fees payable to OFCOM will meet but not exceed the
annual costs of OFCOM in exercising their regulatory functions under the Bill, and
that the fee will be justifiable and proportionate, having regard to the provider’s
revenue and the functions in respect of which the fee is imposed. Where providers do
not notify or pay a fee, then they may be subject to enforcement action as per clause
Clause 51(8) states that “qualifying worldwide revenue” and “qualifying period” will be
defined by regulations made by the Secretary of State. Before making any such
regulations, the Secretary of State must consult with OFCOM.
Justification for the power

“Qualifying worldwide revenue” and “qualifying period’’ underpin the funding regime of
the regulator. “Qualifying worldwide revenue’’ is also a key factor in determining the
applicable penalties. It is vital therefore that both definitions are fit for purpose and
easily understood by industry and stakeholders. By defining the terms in regulations,
the government will be able to draw on OFCOM’s financial expertise and resources.
OFCOM will also be able to relay views from industry following a period of
consultation.
Defining the terms in regulations will also allow for the definitions to be amended in
the future. Flexibility is required to ensure “qualifying worldwide revenue’’ and
“qualifying period’’ remain usable by OFCOM and enable easy reporting by industry.
Justification for the procedure

This power will be subject to the affirmative procedure.
There is likely to be substantial parliamentary interest in the regulations as the subject
matter will underpin OFCOM’s funding and penalty regimes. The affirmative resolution
is therefore considered appropriate in order to provide both Houses the opportunity to
debate and actively approve the content of the instrument.
Clause 53: Threshold figure

Power conferred on: OFCOM and Secretary of State
Power exercised by: Decision
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

The regulator will be funded through contributions from providers of regulated
services whose qualifying worldwide revenue is at or above a specified threshold as
determined by clause 53. Providers with qualifying worldwide revenue at or above the
threshold will have an obligation to notify OFCOM, and pay an annual fee (see clause
52).
OFCOM will set the threshold figure and notify the Secretary of State of the proposed
threshold. The figure should be kept under review and OFCOM will have the power to
amend this figure.
Justification for the power

OFCOM is required to set fees and thresholds for existing regimes in line with the
principles outlined in the Statement of Charging Principles and after consulting with
industry. The Secretary of State is not required to approve those figures and they are
not subject to Parliamentary oversight.
For the online safety regime, OFCOM as the regulator will be best placed to
recommend an appropriate threshold after the regulations under clause 51 have been
made and consultations with industry have taken place. As per clause 54, Secretary
of State guidance, which will have been laid before Parliament, will stipulate the
principles which OFCOM should consider when determining the threshold figure.
OFCOM will be required to provide the Secretary of State with the necessary
evidence collated through the consultations, in order to support its decision as to the
level of the threshold.
The reason for introducing the Secretary of State sign off under this regime is to
confirm that the threshold has been set at a level which leads to affordable and
proportionate fees whilst ensuring OFCOM’s annual operating costs are recouped.
The Secretary of State must decide whether or not to approve the proposed threshold
figure put forward by OFCOM. If the Secretary of State does not approve the
threshold figure for fees, then the Secretary of State must inform OFCOM of this
decision. The Secretary of State must then determine, and subsequently publish, a
threshold figure that the Secretary of State considers appropriate. The process to be
followed in order for the Secretary of State to determine the figure has been agreed
with OFCOM.
Justification for the procedure

OFCOM will ultimately publish the threshold for providers of regulated services. The
provision to be made is administrative rather than legislative in character, and no
parliamentary procedure is considered necessary in line with the existing procedures
for OFCOM’s other regimes.
Clause 54(1): Secretary of State’s guidance

Power conferred on: Secretary of State
Power exercised by: Guidance
Parliamentary procedure: Lay the guidance in Parliament and publish.

Context and purpose

The regulator will be funded through contributions from providers with in-scope
services whose qualifying worldwide revenue is at or above a threshold figure
determined either by OFCOM and approved by the Secretary of State, or by the
Secretary of State if they do not agree OFCOM’s proposed figure (see clause 53).
The Secretary of State must issue guidance to OFCOM about the principles OFCOM
will follow when determining the fees payable by a provider of a regulated service
(see clause 52). The guidance must also set out the principles to be considered by
OFCOM when determining the threshold figure under clause 53.
The Secretary of State must consult OFCOM before issuing, revising or replacing the
guidance. The guidance must also have due regard to HM Treasury’s Managing
Public Money guidance.
The Secretary of State guidance may not be revised or replaced more frequently than
once every three years, unless by agreement between the Secretary of State and
OFCOM or it needs to be corrected as a result of an amendment, repeal or
modification to a provision of the Bill dealing with fees. OFCOM must have regard to
the guidance when exercising its functions relating to fees under this Chapter of the
Bill.
Justification for the power

By stipulating the principles which OFCOM should consider when determining the
threshold figure, the guidance will help assure that OFCOM set the threshold at a
level where burdens are minimised for small businesses. This will ensure that fees
charged by OFCOM will be justifiable and proportionate. Furthermore, the guidance
will ensure that OFCOM sets the fees at a level which allows them to recoup the
annual operating costs of the regulatory regime.
Justification for the procedure

The Secretary of State must lay the initial guidance (and any revised guidance)
before Parliament and publish the guidance issued under this section. As the
guidance does not include any legislative requirements, there is no need for further
Parliamentary scrutiny.
Clause 55(1): Fees statements by OFCOM

Power conferred on: OFCOM
Power exercised by: Statement of Principles
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

The regulator will be funded through contributions from providers with in-scope
services whose qualifying worldwide revenue is at or above a specified threshold (as
determined by clause 53). Unless a provider is categorised as exempt, they will be
required to notify OFCOM should their qualifying worldwide revenue for a qualifying
period be at or above the specified threshold.
OFCOM will be required to publish a Statement of Charging Principles (“the
Statement”) which will set out the principles and processes which OFCOM will adhere
to when setting out the fees payable by a regulated service provider. The Statement
will also detail the information required from providers at the point of notification. The
Secretary of State will publish guidance on the principles to be considered by
OFCOM when drafting the Statement.
Without publication of this document, OFCOM will not be able to require providers to
pay a fee.
Justification for the power

Under the Communications Act 2003, OFCOM is required to set licence fees in the
broadcasting sector and administrative charges in the electronic communications
sector in accordance with charging principles that it has published. There are similar
provisions in the Postal Services Act 2011 in relation to the setting of charges for the
postal services sector. In line with its legislative duties, OFCOM currently publishes a
Statement of Charging Principles which outlines that charges and fees must be set so
as to meet, but not to exceed, OFCOM’s annual costs of regulating the relevant
sector.
The duty to publish the Statement is crucial to ensure consistency with OFCOM’s
other regimes. It is also required to allow for transparency in the online safety funding
regime and clarity for providers and stakeholders. It is expected that OFCOM will
consult with providers of regulated services in preparation of the Statement.
The Statement will be published ahead of each charging year. It will outline how the
fees charged by OFCOM will meet, but not exceed, the costs of carrying out online
safety functions for that charging year. It will also set out how the fees to be charged
to providers are proportionate and justifiable and that there is a transparency in
relation to the costs incurred and fees charged.
The Statement will further set out the information required from a provider at the point
of notification (see clause 51). This information could include details regarding the
relevant qualifying worldwide revenue; details of the regulated service; and any
supporting evidence, documentation or other information specified by OFCOM.
Justification for the procedure

OFCOM will publish the Statement. The provision to be made is administrative rather
than legislative in character, and no parliamentary procedure is considered necessary
in line with the existing procedures for OFCOM’s other regimes.
