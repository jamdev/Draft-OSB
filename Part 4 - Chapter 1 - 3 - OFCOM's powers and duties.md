#### CHAPTER 2

#### REGISTER OF CATEGORIES OF SERVICES

**59 Register of categories of services**


(1) As soon as reasonably practicable after the first regulations under Schedule 4
come into force, OFCOM must—
(a) establish a register of particular categories of regulated services with—
(i) one part for user-to-user services meeting the Category 1
threshold conditions,
(ii) one part for search services meeting the Category 2A threshold
conditions, and
(iii) one part for user-to-user services meeting the Category 2B
threshold conditions;
(b) in relation to each regulated user-to-user service which they consider is
likely to meet the Category 1 threshold conditions, assess whether the
service does, or does not, meet those conditions;
(c) in relation to each regulated search service which they consider is likely
to meet the Category 2A threshold conditions, assess whether the
service does, or does not, meet those conditions;
(d) in relation to each regulated user-to-user service which they consider is
likely to meet the Category 2B threshold conditions, assess whether the
service does, or does not, meet those conditions; and
(e) where they consider that a service meets the relevant threshold
conditions, add entries relating to that service to the relevant part of the
register.


(2) Each part of the register must contain—
(a) the name, and a description, of each regulated service that, in
OFCOM’s opinion, meets the relevant threshold conditions as
provided for by regulations under Schedule 4, and
(b) the name of the provider of each such service.


(3) If OFCOM consider that a regulated user-to-user service meets the Category 1
threshold conditions and the Category 2B threshold conditions, entries relating
to that service are to be added to the part of the register established under
subsection (1)(a)(i) (only).


(4) When assessing whether a regulated service does, or does not, meet the
relevant threshold conditions, OFCOM must take such steps as are reasonably
practicable to obtain or generate information or evidence for the purposes of
the assessment.


(5) OFCOM must publish the register in such manner as they consider appropriate
for bringing it to the attention of persons who, in their opinion, are likely to be
affected by it.


(6) In this Act—
(a) a “Category 1 service” means a regulated user-to-user service for the
time being included in the part of the register established by OFCOM
under subsection (1)(a)(i);
(b) a “Category 2A service” means a regulated search service for the time
being included in the part of the register established by OFCOM under
subsection (1)(a)(ii);

(c) a “Category 2B service” means a regulated user-to-user service for the
time being included in the part of the register established by OFCOM
under subsection (1)(a)(iii).


(7) Schedule 4 contains provision about regulations specifying the threshold
conditions that a service must meet to be included in the relevant part of the
register, and associated provision about the publication of OFCOM’s advice.


(8) In this section, “Category 1 threshold conditions”, “Category 2A threshold
conditions” and “Category 2B threshold conditions” have the same meaning as
in Schedule 4 (see paragraph 1(1), (2) and (3) of that Schedule).

**60 OFCOM’s duty to maintain register**


(1) If regulations are made under paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 4 which amend or
replace regulations previously made under that provision, OFCOM must, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which the amending or
replacement regulations are made—
(a) in relation to each regulated user-to-user service which they consider is
likely to meet the new Category 1 threshold conditions, assess whether
the service does, or does not, meet those conditions, and
(b) make any necessary changes to the register.


(2) If regulations are made under paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 4 which amend or
replace regulations previously made under that provision, OFCOM must, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which the amending or
replacement regulations are made—
(a) in relation to each regulated search service which they consider is likely
to meet the new Category 2A threshold conditions, assess whether the
service does, or does not, meet those conditions, and
(b) make any necessary changes to the register.


(3) If regulations are made under paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 4 which amend or
replace regulations previously made under that provision, OFCOM must, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which the amending or
replacement regulations are made—
(a) in relation to each regulated user-to-user service which they consider is
likely to meet the new Category 2B threshold conditions, assess
whether the service does, or does not, meet those conditions, and
(b) make any necessary changes to the register.


(4) At any other time, if OFCOM consider that a regulated service not included in
a particular part of the register is likely to meet the threshold conditions
relevant to that part, OFCOM must—
(a) assess the service accordingly, and
(b) (subject to section 59(3)) if they consider that the service meets the
relevant conditions, add entries relating to that service to that part of
the register.


(5) A provider of a regulated service included in the register may at any time
request OFCOM to remove entries relating to that service from the register, or
from a particular part of the register.


(6) If OFCOM are satisfied, on the basis of evidence submitted by a provider with
such a request, that since the registration day there has been a change to the
service which appears likely to be relevant, OFCOM must—


(a) assess the service, and
(b) notify the provider of OFCOM’s decision.


(7) OFCOM must remove entries relating to a regulated service from the relevant
part of the register if, following an assessment of the service, they consider that
it no longer meets the threshold conditions relevant to that part.


(8) Section 59(4) applies in relation to an assessment under this section as it applies
to an assessment under section 59.


(9) OFCOM must re-publish the register each time a change is made to it.


(10) See section 104 for provision about appeals against a decision to include a
service in the register (or in a particular part of the register), or not to remove
a service from the register (or from a particular part of the register).


(11) In this section—
“the register” means the register established under section 59;
“the registration day”, in relation to a regulated service, means—
(a) the day on which entries relating to the service were added to
the register, or to the particular part of the register in question,
or
(b) if later, the day on which OFCOM last completed an assessment
of the service under subsection (1), (2), (3) or (6).


(12) In this section, “Category 1 threshold conditions”, “Category 2A threshold
conditions” and “Category 2B threshold conditions” have the same meaning as
in Schedule 4 (see paragraph 1(1), (2) and (3) of that Schedule).

#### CHAPTER 3

#### RISK ASSESSMENTS

**61 Risk assessments by OFCOM**


(1) OFCOM must carry out a risk assessment to identify, assess and understand
the risks of harm to individuals presented by regulated services.


(2) The risk assessment must, amongst other things—
(a) assess the levels of risk of harm presented by regulated services of
different kinds, including by giving separate consideration to—
(i) the risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom
presented by illegal content,
(ii) the risk of harm to children in the United Kingdom, in different
age groups, presented by content that is harmful to children,
and
(iii) the risk of harm to adults in the United Kingdom presented by
content that is harmful to adults;
(b) identify characteristics of different kinds of regulated services that are
relevant to such risks of harm, and assess the impact of those kinds of
characteristics on such risks.


(3) OFCOM must develop risk profiles for different kinds of regulated services,
categorising the services as OFCOM consider appropriate, taking into
account—



(a) the characteristics of the services, and
(b) the risk levels and other matters identified in the risk assessment.


(4) As soon as reasonably practicable after completing a risk assessment, OFCOM
must publish a report on the findings.


(5) OFCOM must ensure that the risk assessment is kept up to date.


(6) In this section the “characteristics” of a service include the functionalities of the
service, its user base, business model, governance and other systems and
processes.


(7) In this section—
“content that is harmful to adults” has the meaning given by section 46;
“content that is harmful to children” has the meaning given by section 45;
“illegal content” has the meaning given by section 41.

**62 OFCOM’s guidance about risk assessments**


(1) As soon as reasonably practicable after OFCOM have completed their first risk
assessment under section 61, OFCOM must prepare guidance for providers of
regulated services to assist them in complying with their duties to carry out
risk assessments under section 7 or 19.


(2) The guidance must include the risk profiles prepared under section 61 (see
subsection (3) of that section).


(3) OFCOM must keep the guidance up to date.


(4) OFCOM must publish the guidance (and any revised or replacement
guidance).

#### EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR THIS SECTION

Part 4: OFCOM'S Powers and Duties in Relation to Regulated Services
Chapter 1: General Duties

Clause 56: General duties of OFCOM under section 3 of the Communications Act 2003

This clause amends OFCOM’s existing general duties under section 3 of the
Communications Act 2003 (CA 2003), by modifying the list of matters which OFCOM
is required to have regard to in carrying out its online safety functions, in order to
accommodate OFCOM’s new role within the online safety legislative framework.
Subsection (2) amends subsection (2) of section 3 of the CA 2003 to provide
that, in the carrying out of its functions in relation to regulated services under this Bill,
OFCOM is also required to secure the appropriate use, by providers of regulated
user-to-user and search services, of systems and processes that protect citizens
from harm arising from these services.
Subsection (3) amends subsection (4) of section 3 of the CA 2003 so that
OFCOM does not need to have regard to the desirability of promoting and facilitating
the development of self-regulation in carrying out its functions under this Bill. OFCOM
must nonetheless continue to have regard to the other factors in section 3(4) of the
CA 2003 in carrying out its online safety functions.
Subsection (4) adds subsection (4A) into section 3 of the CA 2003. Section
3(4A) lists the factors that OFCOM must have regard to in performing its duty to
further the interests of citizens in online safety matters, so long as OFCOM considers
the factor to be relevant.
Subsection (5) introduces subsection (5A) into section 3 of the CA 20 03
which, as noted above, provides that OFCOM does not need to have regard to the
desirability of promoting and facilitating the development of self-regulation in carrying
out its online safety functions.
Subsection (6) introduces subsection (6ZA) into section 3 of the CA 2003.
This new subsection will make it clear that, where OFCOM’s duties under this Bill
conflict with its duty under section 24 of the CA 2003 to provide information to the
Secretary of State to secure compliance with an international obligation, OFCOM’s
duty under section 24 will take priority.
Subsection (8) introduces new subsection (15) into section 3 of the CA 2003
to provide that the terms ‘content’, ‘harm’, ‘provider’ and ‘regulated service’ have the
same meaning as in this Bill.
Subsection (9) also relates to self-regulation and amends section 6 of the CA
2003 to ensure online safety functions are not subject to OFCOM’s duty to consider
whether or not their general duties, set out in section 3, may be furthered or secured,
or are likely to be furthered or secured, by effective self-regulation.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Clause 57: Duties of OFCOM in relation to strategic priorities

This clause sets out OFCOM’s duties in relation to statements of strategic
priorities designated by the Secretary of State under clause 109. For further
information on statements of strategic priorities, see clause 109.
Subsection (2) provides that OFCOM must have regard to the statement of
strategic priorities when carrying out relevant statutory functions relating to online
safety.
Subsection (3) specifies that within 40 days of the statement being issued, or
within a longer period if the Secretary of State allows, OFCOM must explain in a
written, published statement what it proposes to do as a result of the statement of
strategic priorities when exercising its regulatory functions.
Subsection (4) states that after the statement of strategic priorities is
designated, OFCOM must publish an annual review of what it has done with regard
to the strategic priorities outlined in it.
Clause 58: Duty to carry out impact assessments

This clause extends OFCOM’s duty to carry out impact assessments on
important proposals under section 7 of the Communications Act 2003 (CA 2003) to
the online safety sphere, with modifications to accommodate the exercise of the duty
in the online safety context.
Subsection (3) introduces subsection (2A) into section 7 of the CA 2003.
Section 7(2A) of the CA 2003 will provide that all proposals to introduce, replace or
amend codes of practice under this Bill are “important proposals” for the purposes of
OFCOM’s duty to carry out impact assessments. This means that OFCOM will
(subject to urgency considerations) either need to undertake and publish an impact
assessment on these proposals, or to publish a statement detailing why they
consider such an assessment unnecessary.
Subsection (4) introduces subsections (4A) and (4B) into section 7 of the CA
Section 7(4A) of the CA 2003 will provide that all assessments of proposals
mentioned in subsection (2A) must include an assessment of the likely impact of
implementing the proposal on small and micro businesses. Section 7(4B) of the CA
2003 will provide that all assessments of proposals which relate to the carrying out of
OFCOM’s online safety functions must include an assessment of the likely impact of
implementing the proposal on small and micro businesses. If only part of the
proposal relates to OFCOM’s online safety functions, then only that part must be
assessed to determine its likely impact on small and micro businesses.
Chapter 2: Register of Categories of Services

Clause 59 and Schedule 4: Register of categories of services

These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)

The Bill creates different categories of regulated services which will be
subject to additional duties. This clause imposes a duty on OFCOM to establish a
register of these particular categories of regulated services with one part for each of
the following:
a. user-to-user services meeting the Category 1 threshold conditions;
b. search services meeting the Category 2A threshold conditions;
c. user-to-user services meeting the Category 2B threshold conditions.
The threshold conditions are to be specified in regulations made by the
Secretary of State. Once the relevant regulations have been made, under
paragraphs (b) to (e) of subsection (1), OFCOM will be required to assess whether
each regulated service which it considers is likely to meet either the Category 1,
Category 2A or Category 2B threshold conditions does in fact meets those threshold
conditions and, if it does, to add it to the relevant part of the register.
The additional duties placed on providers of Category 1, Category 2A and
Category 2B services are established elsewhere in the Bill but can be summarised as
follows:
a. Category 1 (see clause 5(5) and clause 49): Duties with regard to content that
is harmful to adults, duties to protect content of democratic importance and
journalistic content, additional reporting and redress duties and additional
duties with regard to protecting users’ freedom of expression and privacy
rights. Category 1 services will also have a duty to produce annual
transparency reports.
b. Category 2A and 2B (see clause 49): A duty to produce annual transparency
reports. Such reports may include, for example, information about the
measures service providers are taking to counter illegal content or activity on
their services.
Subsection (2) provides details on what each part of the register should
contain, specifically the name and a description of each regulated service that, in
OFCOM’s opinion, meets the relevant threshold conditions, and the name of the
provider of each of those services.
Subsection (3) provides that, should a regulated user-to-user service meet
both the Category 1 and Category 2B threshold conditions, it should only be added to
the Category 1 part of the register.
Subsection (4) makes clear that OFCOM must make reasonable efforts to
obtain or generate information or evidence for the purposes of assessing a service
against the threshold conditions. Subsection (5) requires OFCOM to publish the
register in whatever manner it considers appropriate for bringing it to the attention of
persons who, in its opinion, are likely to be affected by it.
Subsection (6) makes clear that a service becomes a Category 1, Category
2A or Category 2B service by virtue of being included in the relevant part of the
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
register. This means that the provider of a regulated service has additional duties in
respect of that service once the service is included on the published register.
Schedule 4 requires the Secretary of State to make regulations to specify the
threshold conditions that a regulated service must meet to be included in the relevant
part of the register and makes associated provision about advice from OFCOM: see
clause 59(7).
Subsection (8) provides that the terms “Category 1 threshold conditions”,
“Category 2A threshold conditions”, and “Category 2B threshold conditions” have the
same meaning in this clause as they do in Schedule 4.
Schedule 4

Paragraph 1 (1), (2) and (3) require the Secretary of State to make
regulations setting threshold conditions for Category 1, Category 2A and Category
2B services; that is the conditions which a relevant service must meet in order to be
designated as a Category 1, Category 2A or Category 2B service.
Paragraph 1(4) provides that regulations under sub-paragraphs (1), (2) and
(3) must specify how a service may meet the relevant threshold conditions. For user-
to-user services, at least one threshold condition about number of users and at least
one threshold condition about functionality must be met in order for the service to be
designated as a Category 1 or a Category 2B service and, for search services, at
least one threshold condition about number of users must be met for the service to
be designated as a Category 2A service. Therefore, a user-to-user service assessed
as meeting a Category 1 threshold condition related to the number of users but not
meeting any Category 1 conditions related to functionality would not be designated
as a Category 1 service.
For Category 1 services, paragraph 1(1) provides that such conditions must
only relate to a regulated user-to-user service’s number of users (paragraph 5 makes
it clear that this means the number of UK users) and its functionalities.
In making regulations which set these Category 1 threshold conditions, paragraph
1(5) provides that the Secretary of State must consider how the number of users of a
service and the service’s functionalities will likely affect the risk of harm to adults from
content which is harmful to adults being spread via the service. This requirement to
consider the impact on the risk of harm to adults reflects the fact that providers of
Category 1 services owe additional safety duties on the services in question in
relation to content which is harmful to adults.
For Category 2A services, threshold conditions must relate to a regulated
search service’s number of users (paragraph 5 makes it clear that this means the
number of UK users) and any other factors that the Secretary of State considers
relevant. (Note that there is no requirement for the Secretary of State to specify a
condition relating to the service’s functionalities.) Paragraph 1(6) makes it clear that,
in making regulations which set these threshold conditions, the Secretary of State
must consider how the number of users will likely affect the risk of harm to individuals
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)

from illegal content or content which is harmful to children which may be encountered
in or via search results.
For Category 2B services, threshold conditions must relate to a regulated
user-to-user service’s number of users (paragraph 5 makes it clear that this means
the number of UK users) and its functionalities, and any other factors that the
Secretary of State considers relevant. Paragraph 1(7) makes it clear that, in making
regulations which set these threshold conditions, the Secretary of State must
consider how the number of users and a service’s functionalities will likely affect the
risk of harm to individuals from illegal content or content which is harmful to children
or adults which may be encountered via the service.
Paragraph 2 establishes the procedure for the making of the first set of
regulations under paragraph 1. Sub-paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of paragraph 2 set
out that OFCOM must carry out research to inform the making of these regulations.
a. For Category 1 services, paragraph 2(2) states that OFCOM’s research must
consider the relationship between (on the one hand) the dissemination of
content that is harmful to adults on regulated user-to-user services and (on
the other) the number of users and functionalities of such services. This
reflects the fact that providers of Category 1 services owe additional safety
duties in relation to content which is harmful to adults in respect of those
services.
b. For Category 2A services, paragraph 2(3) provides that OFCOM’s research
must consider the prevalence of illegal content and content which is harmful
to children presented to users in response to searches made by users using
regulated search services; and (on the other) the number of users of such
services; and any other factors OFCOM considers relevant.
c. For Category 2B services, paragraph 2(4) provides that OFCOM’s research
must consider the spreading of illegal content, content that is harmful to
children and content that is harmful to adults via regulated user-to-user
services; and (on the other) the number of users and functionalities of such
services; and any other factors OFCOM considers relevant.
The research must be carried out within six months of Royal Assent.
However, for research in relation to Category 2A and 2B services, paragraph 2(10)
allows for the Secretary of State to give OFCOM extra time to carry out the research,
up to a limit of 18 months after Royal Assent.
OFCOM must then provide advice to the Secretary of State, based on its
research, as to what it thinks would be appropriate threshold conditions for the
regulations to make (paragraph 2(5) of Schedule 4). In respect of Category 2A and
2B threshold conditions, such advice may include advice that the regulations should
include another factor in addition to number of users (and, for user-to-user services,
functionalities), and what that other factor should be.
Paragraph 2(7) states that, as soon as reasonably practicable after OFCOM
has provided its advice, OFCOM must publish this advice and the Secretary of State
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)

must make the regulations. Paragraph 2(11) provides that the Secretary of State
cannot make regulations setting threshold conditions until OFCOM has carried out its
research and provided advice to the Secretary of State. In publishing its advice,
paragraph 4 provides that OFCOM must have regard to the need to exclude
confidential matters (as defined in sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) of paragraph 4) from
publication as far as practicable, and that OFCOM must publish its advice in the
manner it considers appropriate.
If the regulations include provision which differs in any material respect from
what was advised by OFCOM, the Secretary of State must publish a statement
explaining why they have departed from that advice (paragraph 2(8) of Schedule 4).
The publication of such a statement must happen before or at the time of making the
regulations and in such a manner that the Secretary of State believes is appropriate
for bringing it to the attention of persons who may be affected by it.
After the regulations are made, OFCOM will be required to assess services
which it considers are likely to meet the relevant threshold conditions against the
threshold conditions set out in the regulations, and to establish a register of Category
1, Category 2A and Category 2B services (see clause 59(1)). Services become
subject to Category 1, 2A or 2B duties by virtue of being added to the relevant part of
the register.
Paragraph 3 establishes the procedure for updating the threshold conditions
by amending or replacing regulations made under paragraph 1. Paragraphs 3(1), (2)
and (3) state that, for Category 1, Category 2A and Category 2B conditions
respectively, regulations may only be amended or replaced by further regulations,
once OFCOM has carried out further research. The research must consider the same
topics as set out in Paragraphs 2(2), (3) and (4). Paragraph 3(12) states, however,
that such further research is not required where regulations are being made only for
the purpose of correcting existing regulations that were made under paragraph 1.
Paragraph 3(4) states that either OFCOM or the Secretary of State may
initiate the carrying out of this further research and the research should be carried out
to the depth that OFCOM considers appropriate. This ensures that OFCOM is only
required to carry out research insofar as it is proportionate to changes in the areas
which it is researching. If the further research is initiated by a request from the
Secretary of State, paragraph 3(5) provides that the request must state why the
Secretary of State considers further research to be necessary.
Paragraph 3(6) states that following further research being carried out,
OFCOM must advise the Secretary of State whether or not, in OFCOM’s opinion,
changes to the regulations are appropriate (and if it does consider changes
appropriate, what those changes should be). Paragraph 3(7) notes that OFCOM
must publish this advice as soon as reasonably practicable after providing it. In
publishing its advice, paragraph 4 provides that OFCOM must have regard to the
need to exclude confidential matters (as defined in sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) of
paragraph 4) from publication as far as practicable, and that OFCOM must publish its
advice in the manner it considers appropriate.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Paragraphs 3(8) and (9) impose duties on the Secretary of State, if they take
action which departs from OFCOM’s advice. If OFCOM advises the Secretary of
State to amend or replace the regulations, and the Secretary of State does so in line
with OFCOM’s advice, no specific action is needed beyond amending or replacing
the Regulations. However, in any of the following situations, the Secretary of State
must publish a statement explaining their decision:
a. If OFCOM advises the Secretary of State to amend or replace the
Regulations, and the Secretary of State amends or replaces the regulations,
in a way that differs in any material respect from OFCOM’s advice.
b. If OFCOM advises the Secretary of State not to amend or replace the
Regulations, but the Secretary of State chooses to replace or amend the
Regulations.
c. If OFCOM advises the Secretary of State to amend or replace the
Regulations, but the Secretary of State chooses not to replace or amend the
Regulations.
In situations (a) and (b) the statement must, by virtue of paragraphs 3(10) and
3(11), be published before or at the time at which the regulations to which it relates
are made and in such a manner as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for
bringing it to the attention of persons who may be affected by it. In situation (c), the
statement must, by virtue of paragraphs 3(9) and 3(11), be published as soon as
reasonably practicable and also in such a manner as the Secretary of State
considers appropriate for bringing it to the attention of persons who may be affected
by it.
Throughout this Schedule, references to the number of users of a service are
to the number of users of a service who are in the United Kingdom (Paragraph 5).
“User” is defined in clause 122, and includes entities, as well as non-registered users
of services. Paragraph 6 further notes that the meanings of the terms “illegal
content”, “content that is harmful to children” and “content that is harmful to adults”
are as found in clause 41, clause 45 and clause 46 respectively.
Clause 60: OFCOM’s duty to maintain register

This clause sets out OFCOM’s duties with regards to maintaining the register
of regulated services that are designated as either Category 1, Category 2A or
Category 2B. Further detail on the register is set out in clause 59.
Subsections (1), (2) and (3) state that, for Category 1, Category 2A and
Category 2B services respectively, if regulations setting threshold conditions are
amended or replaced, OFCOM must conduct a full reassessment of services which it
considers are likely to meet the amended thresholds set in the relevant regulations. It
must then update the register accordingly. OFCOM must do this as soon as is
reasonably practicable after the date on which the amending or replacement
regulations are made.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
At any other time, subsection (4) requires OFCOM to assess services which
are not on the register, but which it considers are likely to meet the threshold
conditions for designation as a Category 1, Category 2A or Category 2B service, and
to add them to the relevant part of the register accordingly if they are assessed to
meet the threshold conditions. In practice, this allows OFCOM to respond to changes
relating to a regulated service and to ensure that the register remains up-to-date. For
example, the size of a service’s audience may grow rapidly, and/or the functionalities
present on the service may be added to. Should it therefore believe that the service
is now likely to meet the Category 1, Category 2A or Category 2B threshold
conditions, OFCOM would be obliged to assess the service and, if it does in fact
meet the relevant threshold conditions, to add it to that part of the register.
Subsections (5) to (7) allow providers of a service listed in the register to
request the service’s removal from the register. If they make such a request, OFCOM
must first determine whether it is satisfied, based on the evidence submitted by the
provider in question, that there has been a change to the service which appears likely
to be relevant. Only if OFCOM is satisfied that there has been a change which
appears likely to be relevant is OFCOM obliged to assess the service and notify the
provider of its decision. This ensures that OFCOM does not have to do a full
assessment every time a request is made, which could create disproportionate
burdens, but that requests which stem from a genuine change in circumstances will
still receive full consideration. If OFCOM assesses the service to no longer meet the
relevant thresholds, OFCOM must remove it from the relevant part of the register.
Subsection (8) requires OFCOM to take reasonable steps to obtain or
generate information or evidence to inform its assessments of services under this
clause, in the same way as it is required to do for the original assessments
undertaken when the register is first established.
Subsection (9) requires OFCOM to re-publish the register each time a change
is made to it.
Subsection (10) refers to the appeals section of the Bill, for provisions about
appeals against a decision to either include a service in the register, or a decision not
to remove a service from the register.
Subsection (11) defines the terms ‘register’ and ‘registration day’ and
subsection (12) states that the terms “Category 1 threshold conditions”, “Category
2A threshold conditions”, and “Category 2B threshold conditions” have the same
meaning in this clause as they do in Schedule 4.
Chapter 3: Risk assessments

Clause 61: Risk assessments by OFCOM

This clause places a duty on OFCOM to carry out risk assessments to
identify, assess and understand the risks of harm to individuals in the UK presented
by regulated services. It sets out the steps that OFCOM must take to fulfil this duty.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
This includes requirements to develop a risk profile for different kinds of regulated
services and to publish risk assessments and keep them up to date.
Subsection (2) specifies that the risk assessment must, amongst other things,
assess the levels of risk of harm presented by regulated services of different kinds. It
sets out the areas that must be considered when assessing the risk of harm.
Subsection (3) sets out that OFCOM must develop risk profiles for different
kinds of regulated services. OFCOM should categorise these services as it considers
appropriate. This must take into account the services’ characteristics, which include
user base, business model, governance and other systems and processes (see
subsection (6)), the risk levels, and any other relevant matters identified in its risk
assessment.
Subsection (4) requires OFCOM to publish a report on its findings, and
OFCOM must ensure that the risk assessment is kept up to date (subsection (5)).
Clause 62: OFCOM’s guidance about risk assessments

This clause places a duty on OFCOM to produce guidance for providers of
regulated services to assist them in complying with their duties under clauses 7 and
19 (risk assessment duties for user-to-user services and search services
respectively). Subsection (1) sets out that OFCOM must prepare this guidance as
soon as reasonably practicable.
Subsection (2) requires the guidance to include the risk profiles prepared
under clause 61. These risk profiles will categorise the services as OFCOM consider
appropriate, taking into account the characteristics of the services and the risk levels
and other matters identified in the risk assessment
OFCOM must also keep the guidance up-to-date and publish it - including any
revised or replacement guidance: see subsections (3) and (4).

#### DELEGATED POWERS MEMORANDUM
PART 4: OFCOM’S POWERS AND DUTIES IN RELATION TO REGULATED SERVICES
CHAPTER 3: RISK ASSESSMENTS
Clause 62(1): OFCOM’s guidance about risk assessments

Power conferred on: OFCOM
Power exercised by: Guidance
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

Under clause 61 OFCOM must carry out a risk assessment to identify, assess and
understand the risks of harm to individuals presented by regulated services. The risk
assessment must, amongst other things, assess the levels of risk of harm presented
by regulated services of different kinds, and identify characteristics of different kinds
of regulated services that are relevant to such risks of harm, and assess the impact of
those kinds of characteristics on such risks. OFCOM must develop risk profiles for
different kinds of regulated services.
As soon as reasonably practicable after OFCOM have completed their first risk
assessment under clause 61, OFCOM must prepare and publish guidance for
providers of regulated services to assist them in complying with their duties to carry
out risk assessments under clauses 7 and 19 (in respect of user-to-user services and
search services respectively). The guidance must include the risk profiles developed
by OFCOM under clause 61(3). OFCOM is also under a duty to publish the guidance
and to keep it up to date (subsections (4) and (5) of clause 61).
Justification for the power

OFCOM’s guidance is intended to assist providers of regulated services comply with
their duties to carry out risk assessments under clauses 7 and 19.
Such guidance is too detailed to be set out on the face of the legislation. Further, the
power to revise the guidance provides OFCOM with the flexibility to modify its details
in the light of emerging technologies and changes in user behaviour. This will be
essential given the fast-paced and innovative nature of the regulated sector.
Justification for the procedure

Since these provisions are concerned with operational and administrative matters in
the context of how regulated service providers can comply with their duties to perform
risk assessments under the Bill, the provision to be made is administrative rather than
legislative in character. Therefore, no Parliamentary procedure is considered
necessary.
