#### CHAPTER 4

#### USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN RELATION TO TERRORISM CONTENT AND CHILD SEXUAL

#### EXPLOITATION AND ABUSE CONTENT

**63 Use of technology warning notice**


(1) OFCOM may, in accordance with this section, give a notice (a “use of
technology warning notice”) to a provider of a regulated service stating that
OFCOM intend to give the provider a use of technology notice under—
(a) in the case of a user-to-user service, section 64;
(b) in the case of a search service, section 65.


(2) OFCOM may give a use of technology warning notice relating to a regulated
user-to-user service to the provider of the service if they consider that there are
reasonable grounds for believing that the provider is failing to comply with the
duty in section 9 (safety duties about illegal content), so far as relating to
terrorism content or CSEA content (or both those kinds of content), based on
evidence demonstrating—
(a) the prevalence, and
(b) the persistent presence,
of terrorism content or CSEA content or both (as the case may be) on the service
in question.

(3) OFCOM may give a use of technology warning notice relating to a regulated
search service to the provider of the service if they consider that there are
reasonable grounds for believing that the provider is failing to comply with the
duty in section 21 (safety duties about illegal content), so far as relating to
terrorism content or CSEA content (or both those kinds of content), based on
evidence demonstrating—
(a) the prevalence, and
(b) the persistent presence,
of terrorism content or CSEA content or both (as the case may be) in search
results of the service in question.


(4) A use of technology warning notice given to a provider must—
(a) give OFCOM’s reasons for their opinion that the provider is failing to
comply with the duty referred to in subsection (2) or (3) (as the case
may be),
(b) contain details of the technology that OFCOM are considering
requiring the provider to use,
(c) specify whether the technology is to be required in relation to terrorism
content or CSEA content (or both),
(d) specify any other requirements that OFCOM are considering imposing
(see section 64(6) and (7) or section 65(6) and (7)), and
(e) specify the period for which OFCOM are considering imposing the
requirements (see section 66(2)).


(5) A use of technology warning notice given to a provider must—

(2) If, after considering any representations and evidence, OFCOM decide not to
give a use of technology notice to the provider, they must inform the provider
of that fact.


(3) If the conditions mentioned in subsection (5) are met, OFCOM may give the
provider a use of technology notice under this section.


(4) A use of technology notice under this section is a notice relating to a regulated
user-to-user service requiring the provider of the service to do either or both of
the following—
(a) use accredited technology to identify public terrorism content present
on the service and to swiftly take down that content (either by means of
the technology alone or by means of the technology together with the


use of human moderators to review terrorism content identified by the
technology);
(b) use accredited technology to identify CSEA content present on any part
of the service (public or private), and to swiftly take down that content
(either by means of the technology alone or by means of the technology
together with the use of human moderators to review CSEA content
identified by the technology).


(5) The conditions which must be met in relation to the service are as follows—
(a) OFCOM have evidence demonstrating—
(i) the prevalence, and
(ii) the persistent presence,
of terrorism content or CSEA content or both (as the case may be) on the
service,
(b) OFCOM are satisfied that no less intrusive step than the use of the
technology to be specified in the notice is likely to achieve the necessary
reduction in terrorism content or CSEA content present on the service,
and
(c) OFCOM are satisfied that giving the notice is a proportionate means of
addressing the problem of terrorism content or CSEA content present
on the service.


(6) If a provider is already using accredited technology in relation to the service in
question, a use of technology notice under this section may require the
provider to use it more effectively (specifying the ways in which that must be
done).

give a use of technology notice to the provider, they must inform the provider
of that fact.


(3) If the conditions mentioned in subsection (5) are met, OFCOM may give the
provider a use of technology notice under this section.


(4) A use of technology notice under this section is a notice relating to a regulated
search service requiring the provider of the service to do either or both of the
following—
(a) use accredited technology to identify terrorism content in search results
and to swiftly take steps that result in that content no longer appearing
in search results (either by means of the technology alone or by means
of the technology together with the use of human moderators to review
terrorism content identified by the technology);
(b) use accredited technology to identify CSEA content in search results
and to swiftly take steps that result in that content no longer appearing
in search results (either by means of the technology alone or by means
of the technology together with the use of human moderators to review
CSEA content identified by the technology).


(5) The conditions which must be met in relation to the service are as follows—
(a) OFCOM have evidence demonstrating—
(i) the prevalence, and
(ii) the persistent presence,
of terrorism content or CSEA content or both (as the case may be) in
search results of the service,
(b) OFCOM are satisfied that no less intrusive step than the use of the
technology to be specified in the notice is likely to achieve the necessary
reduction in terrorism content or CSEA content in search results of the
service, and
(c) OFCOM are satisfied that giving the notice is a proportionate means of
addressing the problem of terrorism content or CSEA content in search
results of the service.


(6) If a provider is already using accredited technology in relation to the service in
question, a use of technology notice under this section may require the
provider to use it more effectively (specifying the ways in which that must be
done).

period for which it is to have effect,
(e) contain details of the rights of appeal under section 105,
(f) contain information about when OFCOM intend to review the notice
(see section 67), and

(g) contain information about the consequences of not complying with the
notice (including information about the further kinds of enforcement
action that it would be open to OFCOM to take).


(2) A use of technology notice may impose requirements for a period of up to 36
months beginning with the day specified in the notice as the day by which the
notice must be complied with.


(3) A use of technology notice may impose requirements only in relation to the
operation of a regulated service—
(a) in the United Kingdom, or
(b) as it affects United Kingdom users of the service.


(4) For the purposes of sections 64 and 65, technology is “accredited” if it is
accredited (by OFCOM or another person appointed by OFCOM) as meeting
minimum standards of accuracy in the detection of terrorism content or CSEA
content (as the case may be).


(5) Those minimum standards of accuracy must be such standards as are for the
time being approved and published by the Secretary of State, following advice
from OFCOM.

#### EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR THIS SECTION

Chapter 4: Use of technology in relation to terrorism content and child sexual

exploitation and abuse content

Clause 63: Use of Technology Warning Notice

Chapter 4 provides the statutory basis for OFCOM’s power to require a
service provider to use accredited technology to identify and remove terrorist content
on public channels and child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) content on
private and public channels.
Subsection (1) of this clause sets out that if OFCOM has reasonable grounds
for believing that the provider of a user to user service or search service is failing to
comply with the duty in section 9 (safety duties about illegal content) so far as the
duty relates to terrorism and CSEA content, OFCOM may issue a Use of Technology
Warning Notice. The purpose of the Warning Notice is to provide the service provider
with notice that OFCOM is considering requiring it to use the technology that is
specified in the notice.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (2) sets out that if OFCOM has reasonable grounds for believing
that the provider of a regulated user-to-user service is failing to comply with the duty
in section 9 (safety duties about illegal content), so far as relating to terrorism content
or CSEA content (or both those kinds of content), based on evidence demonstrating
— (a) the prevalence, and (b) the persistent presence, of terrorism content or CSEA
content or both on the service in question, it may issue a Use of Technology Warning
Notice.
Subsection (3) sets out that if OFCOM has reasonable grounds for believing
that the provider of a regulated search service is failing to comply with the duty in
section 21 (safety duties about illegal content), so far as relating to terrorism content
or CSEA content (or both those kinds of content), based on evidence demonstrating
— (a) the prevalence, and (b) the persistent presence, of terrorism content or CSEA
content or both on the service in question, it may issue a Use of Technology Warning
Notice.
Subsection (4) sets out the information contained within the Warning Notice.
These include OFCOM’s reasons for issuing the Notice and the type of technology
the service provider would be required to use.
Subsection (5) provides that the service provider in question will have the
opportunity to make representations to OFCOM over a given period, before OFCOM
decide whether to issue a Use of Technology Notice. OFCOM may decide not to
issue a Use of Technology Notice and take no further action.
Clause 64: Use of Technology Notice: user-to-user service

This clause sets out the circumstances under which OFCOM may issue a
Use of Technology Notice to a provider of a regulated user-to-user service, and the
conditions that must be met before the power can be used.
Subsection (1) clarifies when OFCOM may issue a Use of Technology Notice
to the service provider. A Use of Technology Warning Notice (under clause 63) must
have already been issued to a provider of a regulated user-to-user service, and then
the period for written representations under clause 63(5)(b) must have passed.
Subsection (2) sets out that OFCOM may decide not to issue the provider
with a Use of Technology Notice after considering representations from the provider,
or further evidence. OFCOM must notify the provider of its decision.
Subsection (4) states that OFCOM may require a service provider to use
accredited technology to identify public terrorism content included in the service (as
defined in subsection (10)) and/or child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA)
content included in any part of the service. The service must take down that content
swiftly. The requirements will be set out in a Use of Technology Notice.
Subsection 5 (a) - (c) set out the conditions that must be satisfied before
OFCOM can issue a Use of Technology Notice. The conditions are that: OFCOM
must have evidence of persistent and prevalent terrorism and/or CSEA content;
OFCOM must have concluded that any alternative, and less intrusive measures,
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
would not effectively address the problem; OFCOM’s intervention must be a
proportionate means of addressing the problem.
Subsection (6) provides that where a service provider is already using
technology on a voluntary basis, but this is ineffective, OFCOM can still intervene
and require a service provider to use a more effective technology, or the same
technology in a more effective way.
Subsection (7) specifies that OFCOM can include in the notice a requirement
to operate an effective procedure for users to challenge the removal of their content
from the service.
Subsection (8) defines public terrorism content.
Subsection (9) states that OFCOM may vary or revoke a Use of Technology
Notice by issuing a further notice under this section.
Clause 65: Use of Technology Notice: search service

This clause sets out the circumstances under which OFCOM may issue a
Use of Technology Notice to a regulated search service, and the conditions that must
be met before the power can be used.
Subsection (1) clarifies when OFCOM may issue a Use of Technology notice
to the service provider. A Use of Technology Warning Notice (under clause 63) must
have already been issued to a provider of a regulated search service, and the period
for written representations under clause 63 (5)(b) must have passed.
Subsection (2) sets out that OFCOM may decide not to issue the provider
with a Use of Technology Notice after considering representations from the provider,
or further evidence. OFCOM must notify the provider of its decision.
Subsection (4) states that OFCOM may require a service provider to use
accredited technology to identify public terrorism and/or child sexual exploitation and
abuse (CSEA) content included in the search results of a service. The service must
take steps to prevent that content appearing in search results swiftly. The
requirements will be set out in a Use of Technology Notice.
Subsection 5 (a) - (c) set out the conditions that must be satisfied before
OFCOM can issue a Use of Technology Notice. The conditions are that: OFCOM
must have evidence of persistent and prevalent terrorism and/or CSEA content in the
search results of that service; OFCOM must have concluded that any alternative, and
less intrusive measures, would not effectively address the problem; OFCOM’s
intervention must be a proportionate means of addressing the problem.
Subsection (6) provides that where a service provider is already using
technology on a voluntary basis, but this is ineffective, OFCOM can still intervene
and require a service provider to use the same technology in a more effective way.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (7) specifies that OFCOM can include in the notice a requirement
to operate an effective procedure for users to challenge the removal of their content
from the service.
Subsection (8) provides that OFCOM may vary or revoke a notice by issuing
a further notice under this same section.
Clause 66: Use of Technology Notices: supplementary

Subsection (1) sets out the statutory requirements for the information that
must be included in the Use of Technology Notice. These do not need to be exactly
the same as the warning notice because OFCOM may have considered
representations from the service provider.
Subsection (2) sets out that OFCOM can initially issue a Use of Technology
Notice imposing requirements for up to 36 months from the point of implementation.
Subsection (3) states that a Use of Technology Notice may only require a
regulated provider to use accredited technology in relation to regulated services in
the UK or regulated services that affect users in the UK.
Subsections (4) and (5) explain that OFCOM will only be able to require the
use of tools that meet the minimum standards for accuracy for detecting terrorism
and/or CSEA content as set out by the Secretary of State. Any tools that OFCOM
requires the use of must have been accredited by either OFCOM or a delegated third
party as meeting these minimum standards.
Subsection (6) states that within this section, Use of Technology Notice
means the same as in clauses 64 and 65.
Clause 67: Further Use of Technology notice

Subsection (1) sets out that this clause applies where OFCOM has given a
Use of Technology Notice under clause 64 or 65.
Subsection (2) sets out that if there are reasonable grounds for believing that
the provider is failing to comply with the Use of Technology Notice, and the
conditions, as set out in clause 64(5) or 65(5) are still met, OFCOM can revoke the
notice at any time and issue the provider a Further Use of Technology Notice. This
may be in parallel with enforcement measures against the breach of the original
notice.
Subsection (3) requires OFCOM to review the use of the specified technology
within 36 months of the date set by OFCOM in the original notice. Subsection (4)
specifies what OFCOM must consider in its review.
Subsection (5) specifies that following the review, and after consultation with
the provider, OFCOM may give the provider a Further Use of Technology Notice if
OFCOM reasonably consider that there is a significant risk that, without the
continued use of accredited technology, terrorism content or child sexual exploitation
and abuse (CSEA) content (or both) will become prevalent, and persistently present,
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
on the service. Under subsection (6) the conditions set out in Subsections (2)-(5)
apply again.
Subsection (7) allows a Further Use of Technology Notice to require the use
of different accredited technology from an earlier Use of Technology Notice.
Subsection (8) notes that Subsections (4) and (6) to (9) of clause 64, and
clause 66, apply in relation to a Further Use of Technology Notice to a user-to-user
service under this section as they apply in relation to a Use of Technology Notice
under those section(s).
Subsection (9) notes that Subsections (4) and (6) to (8) of clause 65, and
clause 66, apply in relation to a Further Use of Technology Notice to a search service
under this section as they apply in relation to a Use of Technology Notice under
those clauses(s).
Clause 68: Guidance about requiring use of technology

This clause requires OFCOM to issue guidance setting out the circumstances
under which it could require a service provider in scope of the power to use
technology to identify CSEA and/or terrorism.
OFCOM will have the discretion to decide on the exact content of the
guidance and must keep it under review and publish it. OFCOM must also have
regard to its guidance when exercising these powers.
Clause 69: Annual report about use of technology

This clause requires OFCOM to report annually to the Secretary of State, on
the exercise of its power during the last year and on current and in-development
technology that is likely to meet the required minimum standards of accuracy.
Subsection (2) says that the Secretary of State must lay this report before
Parliament.
Subsection (3) cross-refers to section 102 which sets out provisions for
OFCOM excluding confidential information from its published reports.

#### DELEGATED POWERS MEMORANDUM

CHAPTER 4: USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN RELATION TO TERRORISM CONTENT AND
CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND ABUSE CONTENT
Clause 66(5): Use of technology notices: supplementary

Power conferred on: Secretary of State
Power exercised by: Decision
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

As part of the regulator’s enforcement regime, OFCOM will be able to give a provider
of a regulated service a Use of Technology Notice.
A Use of Technology Notice is a notice issued to a regulated user-to-user or search
service requiring the provider of the service to do either or both of the following:
○ Use accredited technology to identify public terrorism content present on the
service or in the search results of the service and to swiftly take down that
content (either by means of the technology alone or by means of the
technology together with the use of human moderators to review terrorism
content identified by the technology);
○ Use accredited technology to identify child sexual exploitation and abuse
content present on any part of the service (public or private) or in the search
results of the service, and to swiftly take down that content (either by means
of the technology alone or by means of the technology together with the use
of human moderators to review CSEA content identified by the technology).
If a provider is already using accredited technology in relation to the service in
question, a Use of Technology Notice may require the provider to use it more
effectively (specifying the ways in which that must be done). This will allow the
regulator to mandate effective use of technology to tackle and prevent terrorism and
CSEA content online.
For the purposes of clauses 64 and 65, technology is “accredited” if it is accredited by
OFCOM or another person appointed by OFCOM as meeting minimum standards of
accuracy in the detection of terrorism content or CSEA content, as the case may be.
Clause 66(5) provides the Secretary of State with the power to set those minimum
standards of accuracy, following advice from OFCOM.
Justification for the power

Protecting children and preventing terrorism is central to the online safety framework.
As such, the framework will ensure that terrorism content and CSEA content is
identified, minimised and removed. Effective use of technology will be an important
part of this process for some services.
Delegating this power will enable the Secretary of State to benefit from OFCOM’s
expertise, or the expertise of a third-party (as appointed by OFCOM) when deciding
on the minimum standards of accuracy.
Delegating this power also enables the updating or introduction of future minimum
standards, ensuring that the framework can adapt to the emergence of new
technologies, changing online behaviour and evolving harms.
This power is a limited one and the wider power to provide a Use of Technology
Notice is set out extensively in primary legislation. This power relates only to the
minimum standards of accuracy which a technology must reach to be accredited. This
will ensure that the Secretary of State is able to set a basic standard, without
interfering with the activities of the regulator or playing any role in deciding which
technologies can be accredited.
Justification for the procedure

Since this provision is concerned with operational matters and is limited to setting a
minimum standard, the provision to be made is administrative rather than legislative in
character. Therefore, no further Parliamentary procedure is considered necessary.
The Secretary of State will also have to consult OFCOM.
Clause 68(1): Guidance about requiring use of technology

Power conferred on: OFCOM
Power exercised by: Guidance
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

If a company takes the steps set out in OFCOM’s codes of practice to minimise the
presence of illegal harms on their services identified by their risk assessments, they
will have fulfilled their safety duties (see clause 9). However, an exception to that
approach has been created because of the seriousness of child sexual exploitation
and abuse and terrorism. United Kingdom related referrals of child abuse images
from industry are now 10 times greater than in 2013 and all of the 2017 terrorist
attacks in the United Kingdom involved the internet to some extent.
If OFCOM has reasonable grounds for believing that the provider is failing to comply
with the duty in clause 9 so far as the duty relates to terrorism and CSEA content,
OFCOM may issue a Use of Technology Warning Notice. This is based on evidence
demonstrating the prevalence and persistent presence of terrorism content on public
channels or CSEA content on public and private channels (as the case may be) on
the service.
Once the period for representations from the service provider has passed, OFCOM
may issue the provider with a formal Use of Technology Notice. The safeguards set
out in clause 64 or 65 must be met before OFCOM is able to issue a Use of
Technology Notice. If a service provider does not comply with a Use of Technology
Notice, OFCOM can issue a Penalty Notice under clause 90 after allowing the
provider the opportunity to make representations on the alleged breach. OFCOM
could also consider pursuing business disruption measures (under clauses 91 to 94)
or issuing a further Use of Technology Notice (under clause 67).
Clause 68 requires OFCOM to produce and publish guidance to providers of user-to-
user services and search services on how OFCOM would exercise its powers under
this Chapter. This is to ensure that service providers are clear in advance on the
circumstances under which the regulator may issue a Use of Technology Notice.
Justification for the power

Collaboration between government, industry, charities and civil society organisations
has led to some progress in tackling CSEA and terrorism content online. But existing
efforts by service providers have not delivered the necessary improvements to tackle
the scale and seriousness of terrorism and CSEA content on their platforms.
Problems persist and cooperation from service providers is inconsistent.
Companies may choose to voluntarily use technology to identify harms on their
platforms. However, it is important that OFCOM can also require a service provider to
use technology to identify terrorism or CSEA where the company has persistent and
prevalent levels of CSEA and/or terrorism on its service and where it is not using
technology to effectively address them.
The scale and severity of the harms and the strict safeguards regulating the use of
technology justify this power. Their use is subject to clear safeguards to ensure
protections for users’ rights to freedom of expression and privacy.
One such safeguard is that OFCOM should set out in guidance how it proposes to
exercise its powers under this clause. This is to provide clarity around the use of the
power. We intend for OFCOM to have the discretion to decide on the exact content of
the guidance.
Justification for the procedure

The provision to be made is administrative rather than legislative in character.
Therefore, no Parliamentary procedure is considered necessary.
