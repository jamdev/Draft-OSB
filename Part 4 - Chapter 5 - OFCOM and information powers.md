significant role in making decisions about the managing and organising of the entity’s
“relevant activities” and also in the actual managing or organising of such activities.

service in connection with information notices. This clause sets out the criminal
offences that can be committed by a provider of a regulated service.
Subsection (2) states that a provider commits an offence if it fails to comply

a report into matters relevant to the purpose in subsection (1) for which OFCOM
exercised its powers (“the relevant matters”), and notify the provider. Alternatively, as

seeking to obtain is required in connection with the exercise by OFCOM of its
functions under this Bill.
Conditions for issue of a warrant

Paragraph (3) deals with the conditions for the issue of a warrant by a justice
for the inspection of premises by OFCOM. Sub-paragraph (1) provides that a justice
may only issue a warrant in relation to premises specified in an application if they are
satisfied on the basis of sworn written evidence that the premises are being used by
the provider of a regulated service in connection with the provision of a regulated
service. In addition, the justice must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to
suspect that the provider is failing to comply, or has failed to comply, with
enforceable requirements relating to that service (see sub-paragraph (3)) and that
there are documents or records on the premises, or documents or records which can
be viewed at the premises, or equipment on the premises, relevant to an OFCOM’s
investigation into that failure. Furthermore, at least one of the conditions below in
sub-paragraph (2) must be satisfied.
Sub-paragraph (2) lists further conditions for issuing a warrant, at least one of
which must be satisfied in addition to those in sub-paragraph (1). The condition in
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
paragraph (a) is that OFCOM has given seven days’ notice to the occupier of the
premises demanding access, but access to the premises at a reasonable hour was
refused or entry was granted but the occupier unreasonably refused to comply with a
request by a person acting on behalf of OFCOM (see Powers exercisable by warrant
at paragraph 5). The condition in paragraph (b) is that OFCOM’s compliance with the
conditions relating to giving notice in paragraph (a) would defeat the object of entry to
the premises (e.g. where there is a risk of evidence destruction) and the condition in
paragraph (c) is that OFCOM requires urgent access to the premises.
Sub-paragraph (3) defines the term “enforceable requirement” with reference
to the duty or requirements in clause 82 and requirements imposed by a use of
technology notice under clauses 64, 65 or 67.
Evidence of authority

Paragraph (4)(1) states that before exercising a power of entry under a
warrant, an authorised person must, if requested to do so, produce evidence of their
identity and outline the purpose for using this power of entry. The authorised person
must also produce, and supply the occupier of the premises with, a copy of the
warrant.
Paragraph (4)(2) states that if the occupier of the premises is not present, and
neither is any other person who appears to the authorised person to be in charge of
the premises, then the authorised person must leave a copy of the warrant in a
prominent place on the premises.
Powers exercisable by warrant

Paragraph (5) lists what a warrant must allow an authorised person to do. The
list is self-explanatory and includes the authorisation to enter the premises specified
in the warrant and to inspect any documents which may be relevant to OFCOM’s
investigation.
Powers of seizure: supplementary

Paragraph (6) deals with powers of seizure (i.e. when a person executing a
warrant seizes a document, record or other thing). Sub-paragraph (2) specifies that
where the person executing a warrant seizes a document or record, they must, on
request, give a receipt for it and give a copy of it to the occupier of the premises (on
request).
Sub-paragraph (3) specifies that the person executing a warrant does not
need to give an occupier of the premises a copy of the document or record if they
consider that this would result in undue delay. Sub-paragraph (4) further specifies
that anything seized may be retained for so long as is necessary.
Further provision about executing warrants

Paragraphs (7) to (13) set out further provisions relating to the execution of a
warrant. Paragraph (7) requires that OFCOM’s entry and search under a warrant
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
must be at a reasonable hour, unless entry at a reasonable hour would frustrate or
seriously prejudice the purpose of the search.
Paragraph (8) provides that entry and search under a warrant must be within
one month of its issue. Paragraph (9) allows an authorised person to take such
persons, equipment and materials onto the premises as they deem to be necessary.
Paragraph (10) states that any person accompanying an authorised person
under paragraph 9 may exercise any of the powers conferred on the authorised
person by paragraph (5) provided that they are being supervised by an authorised
person. Paragraph (11) states that an authorised person may use reasonable force if
necessary (in connection with the exercise of a power under a warrant).
Paragraph (12) provides that a warrant authorises entry on only one
occasion. Paragraph (13) states that if the relevant premises are unoccupied or the
occupier is temporarily absent, the authorised person must leave the premises as
effectively secured against trespassers as they found them.
Return of warrants

Paragraph (14)(1) states that after a warrant has been executed, it must be
returned to the appropriate person (namely, the justice or clerk of the court who
issued the warrant: see sub-paragraph (3)), and that the person who executed the
warrant must write on it a statement of the powers exercised under that warrant.
Paragraph (14)(2) states that if the warrant has not been executed, it must be
returned to the appropriate person within the time authorised for the execution of that
warrant.
Paragraph (14)(4) states that the appropriate person must retain a search
warrant returned in the circumstances stated above in sub-paragraphs (1) or (2) for
12 months from the date of its return.
Paragraph (14)(5) states that during that 12 month period, if the occupier of
the premises stated in the warrant asks to inspect that warrant, they must be allowed
to do so.
Restrictions on powers under paragraphs 2 and 3

Paragraph (15) applies limitations to the powers set out in paragraph (2),
relating to entry and inspection of premises without a warrant, and to powers
exercisable under a warrant.
Sub-paragraph (2) states that these powers are not exercisable in respect of
a dwelling.
Sub-paragraph (3) excludes documents subject to legal privilege from the
scope of these powers (or, in Scotland, to confidentiality of communications).
Interpretation

These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Paragraphs (16) to (18) define “premises”, “warrant” and “justice” for the
purposes of this Schedule. These definitions are self explanatory. Paragraphs (19)
and (20) specify some points around interpretation when paragraph (3)(1) is applied
in Scotland or Northern Ireland. For Scotland, references to sworn information in
writing has effect as a reference to evidence on oath and for Northern Ireland, this
reference has effect as a reference to a complaint on oath.
Disclosure of information

Clause 78: Provision of information to the Secretary of State

The clause makes amendments to Section 24B of the Communications Act
2003 (CA 2003), which allows OFCOM to provide information to the Secretary of
State that OFCOM considers may assist the Secretary of State in the formulation of
policy.
Subsection (2) amends section 24B(2) CA 2003 so that, where information
relating to a particular business has been obtained using a power under the Online
Safety Bill, OFCOM may not provide this information to the Secretary of State without
the consent of the person carrying on that business whilst the business is carried on.
This does not affect the fact that consent must still also be obtained where the
information that OFCOM intends to share has been acquired using powers in the CA
2003, the Broadcasting Act 1990, the Broadcasting Act 1996, the Wireless
Telegraphy Act 2006 or Part 3 of the Postal Services Act 2011 (which were already
listed in section 24B(2) of CA 2003).
Subsection (3) inserts a new subsection (3) into section 24B of the CA 2003.
This new subsection provides that section 24B(2) does not apply, and therefore the
consent of the person carrying on the relevant business is not required, where the
information which OFCOM intends to share is reasonably required by the Secretary
of State and:
a. was obtained by OFCOM using a power under clause 70 in order to
determine a proposed threshold figure, which if met or exceeded by providers
renders them liable to pay fees to OFCOM; or
b. was obtained by OFCOM using the power under clause 112(5) to require
information from a provider of a regulated service in response to potential
threats to national security, or to the health or safety of the public.
Clause 79: Disclosure of information

This clause amends section 393 of the Communications Act 2003 (CA 2003)
(general restrictions on disclosure of information) to include new provisions under this
Bill. Section 393 provides that, subject to specific exceptions, information obtained by
OFCOM in the exercise of its functions under the CA 2003, Broadcasting Act 1990
and Broadcasting Act 1996 cannot be disclosed without the consent of the business
in question.
Subsection (2) inserts a reference to “the Online Safety Act 2021” into section
393(1) of the CA 2003. This would mean that, subject to the exceptions detailed
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
below, where OFCOM has obtained information about a business by exercising its
powers under this Bill, it cannot disclose this information without the consent of the
business in question.
Subsection (3) amends the list of exceptions in section 393 of the CA 2003 so
OFCOM could disclose information about a business, without its consent, for the
purposes of any civil proceedings brought under this Bill.
Subsection (4) amends section 393 of the CA 2003 subsection (6) so as to
not limit what can be published by OFCOM under Schedule 4 to the Bill. This
Schedule deals with regulations specifying threshold conditions for categories of
regulated services.
Similarly, subsection (5) amends section 393 of the CA 2003 subsection
(6)(b), which ensures that section 393 of the CA 2003 does not limit the matters that
may be included in, or made public as part of, a report made by OFCOM under this
Bill.
