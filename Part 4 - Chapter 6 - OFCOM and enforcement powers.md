#### CHAPTER 6

#### ENFORCEMENT POWERS


Provisional notices and confirmation decisions

**80 Provisional notice of enforcement action**


(1) OFCOM may, in accordance with this section, give a person a notice stating
that they intend to take enforcement action (a “provisional notice of
enforcement action”).


(2) Subject to section 81, OFCOM may give a provisional notice of enforcement
action relating to a regulated service to the provider of the service if they
consider that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the provider has
failed, or is failing, to comply with any enforceable requirement referred to in
section 82 that applies in relation to the service.


(3) OFCOM may also give a provisional notice of enforcement action to a person
on either of the grounds in subsection (4).


(4) The grounds are—
(a) the person has been given an information notice and OFCOM consider
that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person has
failed, or is failing, to comply with either of the duties set out in section
70(10) (duties in relation to information notices), or
(b) the person is required by a skilled person appointed under section 74
to give assistance to the skilled person, and OFCOM consider that there
are reasonable grounds for believing that the person is in breach of the
duty in subsection (8) of that section to give such assistance.


(5) A provisional notice of enforcement action given to a person must—
(a) specify the duty or requirement with which (in OFCOM’s opinion) the
person has failed, or is failing, to comply,
(b) give OFCOM’s reasons for their opinion that the person has failed, or
is failing, to comply with it, and
(c) specify what steps OFCOM consider the person needs to take in order
to—
(i) comply with it, or
(ii) remedy the failure.


(6) A provisional notice of enforcement action may also state that OFCOM
propose to impose a penalty on the person, and in such a case the notice must—
(a) state the reasons why OFCOM propose to impose a penalty, and
(b) indicate the amount of the penalty that OFCOM propose to impose,
including any aggravating or mitigating factors that they propose to
take into account.


(7) A provisional notice of enforcement action given to a person must—
(a) state that the person may make written representations (with any
supporting evidence) about the matters contained in the notice, and
(b) specify the period within which such representations may be made.


(8) A provisional notice of enforcement action may be given in respect of a failure
to comply with more than one enforceable requirement.
(9) Where a provisional notice of enforcement action is given in respect of a
continuing failure, the notice may be given in respect of any period during
which the failure has continued, and must specify that period.


(10) Where a provisional notice of enforcement action is given to a person in respect
of a failure to comply with a duty or requirement (“the first notice”), a further
provisional notice of enforcement action in respect of a failure to comply with
that same duty or requirement may be given to the person only—
(a) in respect of a separate instance of the failure after the time at which the
first notice was given,
(b) where a period was specified in the first notice in accordance with
subsection (9), in respect of the continuation of the failure after the end
of that period, or
(c) if the first notice has been withdrawn without a penalty being imposed
by a confirmation decision in respect of the failure (see section 83(6)).

**81 Prevalent and persistent terrorism or CSEA content**


(1) This section applies where OFCOM consider that there are reasonable grounds
for believing that a person is failing to comply with the duty in section 9 or (as
the case may be) 21 (safety duties about illegal content), so far as relating to
terrorism content or CSEA content (or both those kinds of content), in relation
to a regulated service of which that person is the provider, based on evidence
demonstrating the prevalence, and persistent presence, of terrorism content or
CSEA content (or both)—
(a) in the case of a user-to-user service, on the service;
(b) in the case of a search service, in search results of the service.


(2) OFCOM may not give the person a provisional notice of enforcement action if
they are satisfied that the person is complying with all other enforceable
requirements referred to in section 82 that apply in relation to the service.


(3) If however OFCOM consider that there are reasonable grounds for believing
that the person has failed, or is failing, to comply with any other enforceable
requirement that applies in relation to the service, OFCOM may give the
person a provisional notice of enforcement action in relation to that failure.


(4) See section 63 for action that OFCOM may take where this section applies (use
of technology warning notice).


(5) In a case mentioned in subsection (3), OFCOM may give a person both a
provisional notice of enforcement action and a use of technology warning
notice under section 63.

**83 Confirmation decisions**


(1) This section applies if—
(a) a provisional notice of enforcement action has been given to a person in
relation to a failure to comply with a duty or requirement (or with
duties or requirements), and
(b) the period allowed for representations has expired.
A duty or requirement to which the provisional notice of enforcement action
relates is referred to in this section as a “notified requirement”.

(2) If, after considering any representations and evidence, OFCOM decide not to
give a confirmation decision to the person, they must inform the person of that
fact.


(3) If the conditions in subsection (5) or (6) are met, OFCOM may give the person
a confirmation decision.


(4) A confirmation decision is a notice—
(a) imposing requirements as described in subsection (5),
(b) imposing a penalty as described in subsection (6), or
(c) doing both those things.


(5) If OFCOM are satisfied that the person—
(a) has failed, or has been failing, to comply with a notified requirement,
and
(b) is still failing to comply with it,
the confirmation decision may require the person to take steps to comply with
that requirement or to remedy the failure.


(6) If—
(a) the provisional notice of enforcement action states that OFCOM
propose to impose a penalty, and
(b) OFCOM are satisfied that the person has failed, or has been failing, to
comply with a notified requirement,
the confirmation decision may require the person to pay to OFCOM a penalty
of an amount in sterling specified in the decision.


(7) A confirmation decision that includes requirements as described in subsection
(5) must—
(a) give OFCOM’s reasons for their decision to impose those requirements,
(b) specify any notified requirement,
(c) require the person to whom the notice is given to take steps specified in
the confirmation decision in order to—
(i) comply with any notified requirement, or

enforcement action that it would be open to OFCOM to take).


(8) A confirmation decision that includes a requirement to pay a penalty must—
(a) give OFCOM’s reasons for their decision to impose the penalty,
(b) specify any notified requirement,
(c) state the reasons for the amount of the penalty, including any
aggravating or mitigating factors that OFCOM have taken into account,

beginning with the day on which the confirmation decision is given.
(10) A confirmation decision may impose requirements as described in subsection
(5) only in relation to the design or operation of a regulated service—
(a) in the United Kingdom, or
(b) as it affects United Kingdom users of the service.


(11) A confirmation decision may not impose a requirement—
(a) in the case of a user-to-user service, to use technology to identify a
particular kind of content present on the service with a view to taking
down such content;
(b) in the case of a search service, to use technology to identify a particular
kind of content in search results with a view to such content no longer
appearing in search results.


(12) A confirmation decision may impose separate penalties for failure to comply
with separate notified requirements specified in the decision.


(13) Where a provisional notice of enforcement action is given in respect of a period
of continuing failure, no more than one penalty may be imposed by a
confirmation decision in respect of the period of failure specified in the
provisional notice of enforcement action.


(14) But where a confirmation decision includes a requirement as described in
subsection (5) in respect of a continuing failure, the confirmation decision may
impose a penalty in respect of each day that that same failure continues after
the expiry of the period specified in the confirmation decision as the period
within which the requirements imposed by that decision must be complied
with.

**84 Compliance with certain requirements of confirmation decisions**

must, in particular, take into account—
(a) any representations made, and evidence provided, by the person;
(b) any steps taken by the person towards—
(i) complying with any duty or requirement specified in (as the

(5) But if the person does not have an accounting period, the maximum amount of
the penalty for which the person is liable is £18 million.


(6) The maximum amount of a penalty for which a person not within subsection
(4) is liable is £18 million.


(7) For the purposes of subsection (4)(b), a person’s “qualifying worldwide
revenue” is—
(a) the amount of the person’s qualifying worldwide revenue for the
person’s most recent complete accounting period; or
(b) where OFCOM are deciding the amount of the penalty at a time when
that person’s first accounting period has not yet ended, the amount that
OFCOM estimate to be the person’s likely qualifying worldwide
revenue for that period.

(a) if the duration of a person’s most recent complete accounting period is
less than a year, the amount mentioned in subsection (7)(a) or (b) is to
be proportionately increased;
(b) if the duration of a person’s most recent complete accounting period is
more than a year, that amount is to be proportionately reduced.


(9) For the purposes of subsection (7), the amount of a person’s qualifying
worldwide revenue for an accounting period is, in the event of a disagreement
between the person and OFCOM, the amount determined by OFCOM.


(10) The amount of a penalty imposed on a person by a confirmation decision may
not exceed the amount of the penalty proposed in the provisional notice of
enforcement action given to the person.


(11) Subsections (4) to (6) also apply to determine the maximum aggregate amount
of daily penalties imposed by a confirmation decision (see section 83(14)).


(12) See also section 392 of the Communications Act (which requires OFCOM to
produce guidelines about their determination of the amount of penalties that
they impose).


(13) In this section “accounting period” means a period in respect of which a person
is required (by law or, in the case of an entity, the constitution of the entity) to
prepare accounts—
(a) in the case of an entity, in respect of the entity, or
(b) in the case of an individual, in respect of the individual’s business of
providing a regulated service.


(14) In this section “qualifying worldwide revenue” has the meaning given to it by
regulations made by the Secretary of State.


(15) The Secretary of State must consult OFCOM before making regulations under
subsection (14).

**86 Amount of penalties: group of entities**


(1) This section applies if, in accordance with section 119 or 121, two entities are
jointly and severally liable for a penalty imposed by—
(a) a confirmation decision (see section 83(6)), or
(b) a penalty notice under section 84(3).


(2) Subsections (3) to (5) of this section apply instead of section 85(4) to (7).


(3) The maximum amount of the penalty is whichever is the greater of—
(a) £18 million, and
(b) 10% of the qualifying worldwide revenue of the group of entities of
which the two entities are members.


(4) For the purposes of subsection (3)(b), the “qualifying worldwide revenue” of a
group of entities is—
(a) the amount of the group’s qualifying worldwide revenue for the most
recent complete accounting period of the entities liable for the penalty;
or
(b) where OFCOM are deciding the amount of the penalty at a time when
the first accounting period of the entities liable for the penalty has not
yet ended, the amount that OFCOM estimate to be the group’s likely
qualifying worldwide revenue for that period.


(5) In a case where the accounting periods of the entities liable for the penalty are
different—
(a) the reference in subsection (4)(a) to the accounting period of the entities
is to be read as a reference to the accounting period of either of the
entities (at OFCOM’s discretion), and
(b) subsection (4)(b) is to apply as if—
(i) for “the first accounting period of the entities” there were
substituted “the first accounting period of both of the entities”,
and
(ii) for “that period” there were substituted “the accounting period
of either of the entities (at OFCOM’s discretion)”.


(6) Subsections (8) and (9) of section 85 are to be read with the necessary
modifications in their application for the purposes of this section.


(7) In this section, “qualifying worldwide revenue” has the same meaning as in
section 85, and regulations under subsection (14) of that section may include
provision dealing with the application of that term to a group of entities.

“accounting period” means a period in respect of which an entity is
required (by law or the constitution of the entity) to prepare accounts;
“group of entities” means a parent undertaking and its subsidiary

(9) For the purposes of this section, section 1162 of, and Schedule 7 to, the
Companies Act 2006—
(a) are to apply in relation to an entity which is not an undertaking (as
defined in section 1161(1) of that Act) as they apply in relation to an
undertaking, and

formed under the law of a country outside the United Kingdom.

**87 Penalties: further provision**

Business disruption measures

**91 Service restriction orders**


(1) OFCOM may apply to the court for an order under this section (a “service
restriction order”) in relation to a regulated service where OFCOM consider
that—
(a) the grounds in subsection (3) apply in relation to the service, or
(b) the grounds in subsection (4) apply in relation to the service.


(2) A service restriction order is an order imposing requirements on one or more
persons who provide an ancillary service in relation to a regulated service (see
subsection (11)).


(3) The grounds mentioned in subsection (1)(a) are that—
(a) the provider of the regulated service has failed to comply with an
enforceable requirement referred to in section 82 that applies in relation
to the regulated service,
(b) the failure is continuing, and
(c) either—
(i) the provider has failed to comply with a requirement imposed
by a confirmation decision that is of a kind mentioned in section
83(5) relating to the failure,
(ii) the provider has failed to pay a penalty imposed by a
confirmation decision relating to the failure (and the
confirmation decision did not impose any requirements
mentioned in section 83(5)),
(iii) the provider would be likely to fail to comply with a
confirmation decision if given, or
(iv) the circumstances of the failure or the risks of harm to
individuals in the United Kingdom are such that it is
appropriate to make the application without having given a
provisional notice of enforcement action, without having given
a confirmation decision, or (having given a confirmation

decision) without waiting to ascertain compliance with the
decision.


(4) The grounds mentioned in subsection (1)(b) are that—
(a) the provider of the regulated service has failed to comply with a use of
technology notice under section 64, 65 or 67 that relates to the service,
and
(b) the failure is continuing.


(5) An application by OFCOM for a service restriction order must—
(a) specify the regulated service in relation to which the application is
made (“the relevant service”),
(b) specify the provider of that service (“the non-compliant provider”),
(c) specify the grounds on which the application is based, and contain
evidence as to such grounds,
(d) specify the persons on whom (in OFCOM’s opinion) the requirements
of the order should be imposed,
(e) contain evidence as to why OFCOM consider that the persons
mentioned in paragraph (d) provide an ancillary service in relation to
the relevant service, and specify any such ancillary service provided,
(f) specify the requirements which OFCOM consider that the order should
impose on such persons, and
(g) in the case of an application made without notice having been given to
the non-compliant provider, or to the persons mentioned in paragraph
(d), state why no notice has been given.


(6) The court may make a service restriction order imposing requirements on a
person in relation to the relevant service if the court is satisfied—
(a) as to the grounds in subsection (3) or the grounds in subsection (4) (as
the case may be),
(b) that the person provides an ancillary service in relation to the relevant
service,
(c) that it is appropriate to make the order for the purposes of preventing
harm to individuals in the United Kingdom, and the order is
proportionate to the risk of such harm,
(d) in the case of an application made on the ground in subsection (3)(c)(iii)
or (iv), that it is appropriate to make the order before a provisional
notice of enforcement action or confirmation decision has been given,
or before compliance with a confirmation decision has been ascertained
(as the case may be), and
(e) if no notice of the application has been given to the non-compliant
provider, or to the persons on whom requirements are being imposed,
that it is appropriate to make the order without notice.


(7) When considering whether to make a service restriction order in relation to the
relevant service, and when considering what provision it should contain, the
court must take into account (amongst other things) the rights and obligations
of all relevant parties, including those of—
(a) the non-compliant provider,
(b) the person or persons on whom the court is considering imposing the
requirements, and
(c) United Kingdom users of the relevant service.


(8) A service restriction order made in relation to the relevant service must—


(a) identify the non-compliant provider,
(b) identify the persons on whom the requirements are imposed, and any
ancillary service to which the requirements relate,
(c) require such persons to take the steps specified in the order, or to put in
place arrangements, that have the effect of withdrawing the ancillary
service to the extent that it relates to the relevant service (or part of it),
or preventing the ancillary service from promoting or displaying
content that relates to the relevant service (or part of it) in any way,
(d) specify the date by which the requirements in the order must be
complied with, and
(e) specify the date on which the order expires, or the time period for
which the order has effect.


(9) The steps that may be specified or arrangements that may be required to be put
in place—
(a) include steps or arrangements that will or may require the termination
of an agreement (whether or not made before the coming into force of
this section), or the prohibition of the performance of such an
agreement, and
(b) are limited, so far as that is possible, to steps or arrangements relating
to the operation of the relevant service as it affects United Kingdom
users.


(10) OFCOM must inform the Secretary of State as soon as reasonably practicable
after a service restriction order has been made.


(11) For the purposes of this section, a service is an “ancillary service” in relation to
a regulated service if the service facilitates the provision of the regulated
service (or part of it), whether directly or indirectly, or displays or promotes
content relating to the regulated service (or to part of it).


(12) Examples of ancillary services include—
(a) services, provided (directly or indirectly) in the course of a business,
which enable funds to be transferred in relation to a regulated service,
(b) search engines which generate search results displaying or promoting
content relating to a regulated service,
(c) user-to-user services which make content relating to a regulated service
available to users, and
(d) services which use technology to facilitate the display of advertising on
a regulated service (for example, an ad server or an ad network).


(13) In this section “the court” means—
(a) in England and Wales, the High Court or the county court,
(b) in Scotland, the Court of Session or a sheriff, and
(c) in Northern Ireland, the High Court or a county court.

**92 Interim service restriction orders**


(1) OFCOM may apply to the court for an interim order under this section (an
“interim service restriction order”) in relation to a regulated service where
OFCOM consider that—
(a) the grounds in subsection (3) apply in relation to the service, or
(b) the grounds in subsection (4) apply in relation to the service.

(2) An interim service restriction order is an interim order imposing requirements
on one or more persons who provide an ancillary service in relation to a
regulated service (see subsection (9)).


(3) The grounds mentioned in subsection (1)(a) are that—
(a) it is likely that the provider of the regulated service is failing to comply
with an enforceable requirement referred to in section 82 that applies in
relation to the regulated service, and
(b) the level of risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom relating
to the likely failure, and the nature and severity of that harm, are such
that it would not be appropriate to wait to establish the failure before
applying for the order.


(4) The grounds mentioned in subsection (1)(b) are that—
(a) it is likely that the provider of the regulated service is failing to comply
with a use of technology notice under section 64, 65 or 67 that relates to
the service, and
(b) the level of risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom relating
to the likely failure, and the nature and severity of that harm, are such
that it would not be appropriate to wait to establish the failure before
applying for the order.


(5) An application by OFCOM for an interim service restriction order must—
(a) specify the regulated service in relation to which the application is
made (“the relevant service”),
(b) specify the provider of that service (“the non-compliant provider”),
(c) specify the grounds on which the application is based, and contain
evidence as to such grounds,
(d) specify the persons on whom (in OFCOM’s opinion) the requirements
of the order should be imposed,
(e) contain evidence as to why OFCOM consider that the persons
mentioned in paragraph (d) provide an ancillary service in relation to
the relevant service, and specify any such ancillary service provided,
(f) specify the requirements which OFCOM consider that the order should
impose on such persons, and
(g) in the case of an application made without notice having been given to
the non-compliant provider, or to the persons mentioned in paragraph
(d), state why no notice has been given.


(6) The court may make an interim service restriction order imposing
requirements on a person in relation to the relevant service if the court is
satisfied—
(a) as to the ground in subsection (3)(a) or the ground in subsection (4)(a)
(as the case may be),
(b) that the person provides an ancillary service in relation to the relevant
service,
(c) that there are prima facie grounds to suggest that an application for a
service restriction order under section 91 would be successful,
(d) that the level of risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom
relating to the likely failure mentioned in subsection (3)(a) or (4)(a)
(whichever applies), and the nature and severity of that harm, are such
that it is not appropriate to wait for the failure to be established before
making the order, and
(e) if no notice of the application has been given to the non-compliant
provider, or to the persons on whom requirements are being imposed,
that it is appropriate to make the order without notice.


(7) An interim service restriction order ceases to have effect on the earlier of—
(a) the date specified in the order, or the date on which the time period
specified in the order expires (as the case may be), or
(b) the date on which the court makes a service restriction order under
section 91 in relation to the relevant service that imposes requirements
on the same persons on whom requirements are imposed by the
interim order, or dismisses the application for such an order.


(8) Subsections (7) to (10) of section 91 apply in relation to an interim service
restriction order under this section as they apply in relation to a service
restriction order under that section.


(9) In this section, “ancillary service” and “the court” have the same meaning as in
section 91 (see subsections (11), (12) and (13) of that section).

**93 Access restriction orders**


(1) OFCOM may apply to the court for an order under this section (an “access
restriction order”) in relation to a regulated service where OFCOM consider
that—
(a) the grounds in section 91(3) or (4) apply in relation to the service, and
(b) either—
(i) a service restriction order under section 91 or an interim service
restriction order under section 92 has been made in relation to
the failure, and it was not sufficient to prevent significant harm
arising to individuals in the United Kingdom as a result of the
failure, or
(ii) the likely consequences of the failure are such that if a service
restriction order or an interim service restriction order were to
be made, it would be unlikely to be sufficient to prevent
significant harm arising to individuals in the United Kingdom
as a result of the failure,
and in this paragraph, “the failure” means the failure mentioned in
section 91(3)(a) or (4)(a) (as the case may be).


(2) An access restriction order is an order imposing requirements on one or more
persons who provide an access facility in relation to a regulated service (see
subsection (10)).


(3) An application by OFCOM for an access restriction order must—
(a) specify the regulated service in relation to which the application is
made (“the relevant service”),
(b) specify the provider of that service (“the non-compliant provider”),
(c) specify the grounds on which the application is based, and contain
evidence as to such grounds,
(d) specify the persons on whom (in OFCOM’s opinion) the requirements
of the order should be imposed,
(e) contain evidence as to why OFCOM consider that the persons
mentioned in paragraph (d) provide an access facility in relation to the
relevant service, and specify any such access facility provided,

(f) specify the requirements which OFCOM consider that the order should
impose on such persons, and
(g) in the case of an application made without notice having been given to
the non-compliant provider, or to the persons mentioned in paragraph
(d), state why no notice has been given.


(4) The court may make an access restriction order imposing requirements on a
person in relation to the relevant service if the court is satisfied—
(a) as to the grounds in subsection (1),
(b) that the person provides an access facility in relation to the relevant
service,
(c) that it is appropriate to make the order for the purposes of preventing
significant harm to individuals in the United Kingdom, and the order
is proportionate to the risk of such harm,
(d) in the case of an application made on the ground in subsection (3)(c)(iii)
or (iv) of section 91 (by virtue of subsection (1)(a)), that it is appropriate
to make the order before a provisional notice of enforcement action or
confirmation decision has been given, or before compliance with a
confirmation decision has been ascertained (as the case may be), and
(e) if no notice of the application has been given to the non-compliant
provider, or to the persons on whom requirements are being imposed,
that it is appropriate to make the order without notice.


(5) When considering whether to make an access restriction order in relation to the
relevant service, and when considering what provision it should contain, the
court must take into account (amongst other things) the rights and obligations
of all relevant parties, including those of—
(a) the non-compliant provider,
(b) the person or persons on whom the court is considering imposing the
requirements, and
(c) United Kingdom users of the relevant service.


(6) An access restriction order made in relation to the relevant service must—
(a) identify the non-compliant provider,
(b) identify the persons on whom the requirements are imposed, and any
access facility to which the requirements relate,
(c) require such persons to take the steps specified in the order, or to put in
place arrangements, to withdraw, adapt or manipulate the access
facility in order to impede users’ access (by means of that facility) to the
relevant service (or to part of it),
(d) specify the date by which the requirements in the order must be
complied with, and
(e) specify the date on which the order expires, or the time period for
which the order has effect.


(7) The steps that may be specified or arrangements that may be required to be put
in place—
(a) include steps or arrangements that will or may require the termination
of an agreement (whether or not made before the coming into force of
this section), or the prohibition of the performance of such an
agreement,
(b) are limited, so far as that is possible, to steps or arrangements that
impede the access of United Kingdom users, and
(c) are limited, so far as that is possible, to steps or arrangements that do
not affect such users’ ability to access any other internet services.


(8) OFCOM must inform the Secretary of State as soon as reasonably practicable
after an access restriction order has been made.


(9) Where a person who provides an access facility takes steps or puts in place
arrangements required by an access restriction order, OFCOM may, by notice,
require that person to (where possible) notify persons in the United Kingdom
who attempt to access the relevant service via that facility of the access
restriction order (and where a confirmation decision has been given to the non-
compliant provider, the notification must refer to that decision).


(10) For the purposes of this section, a facility is an “access facility” in relation to a
regulated service if the person who provides the facility is able to withdraw,
adapt or manipulate it in such a way as to impede access (by means of that
facility) to the regulated service (or to part of it) by United Kingdom users of
that service.


(11) Examples of access facilities include—
(a) internet access services by means of which a regulated service is made
available, and
(b) application stores through which a mobile application for a regulated
service may be downloaded or otherwise accessed.


(12) In this section—
“the court” means—
(a) in England and Wales, the High Court or the county court,
(b) in Scotland, the Court of Session or a sheriff, and
(c) in Northern Ireland, the High Court or a county court;
“facility” means any kind of service, infrastructure or apparatus enabling
users of a regulated service to access the regulated service;
“internet access service” means a service that provides access to virtually
all (or just some) of the end points of the internet.

**94 Interim access restriction orders**


(1) OFCOM may apply to the court for an interim order under this section (an
“interim access restriction order”) in relation to a regulated service where
OFCOM consider that—
(a) the grounds in section 92(3) or (4) apply in relation to the service, and
(b) either—
(i) a service restriction order under section 91 or an interim service
restriction order under section 92 has been made in relation to
the likely failure, and it was not sufficient to prevent significant
harm arising to individuals in the United Kingdom as a result
of the failure, or
(ii) the likely consequences of such a failure would be such that if a
service restriction order or an interim service restriction order
were to be made, it would be unlikely to be sufficient to prevent
significant harm arising to individuals in the United Kingdom
as a result of the failure,
and in this section, “the likely failure” means the likely failure
mentioned in section 92(3)(a) or (4)(a) (as the case may be).

(2) An interim access restriction order is an interim order imposing requirements
on one or more persons who provide an access facility in relation to a regulated
service (see subsection (8)).


(3) An application by OFCOM for an interim access restriction order must—
(a) specify the regulated service in relation to which the application is
made (“the relevant service”),
(b) specify the provider of that service (“the non-compliant provider”),
(c) specify the grounds on which the application is based, and contain
evidence as to such grounds,
(d) specify the persons on whom (in OFCOM’s opinion) the requirements
of the order should be imposed,
(e) contain evidence as to why OFCOM consider that the persons
mentioned in paragraph (d) provide an access facility in relation to the
relevant service, and specify any such access facility provided,
(f) specify the requirements which OFCOM consider that the order should
impose on such persons, and
(g) in the case of an application made without notice having been given to
the non-compliant provider, or to the persons mentioned in paragraph
(d), state why no notice has been given.


(4) The court may make an interim access restriction order imposing requirements
on a person in relation to the relevant service if the court is satisfied—
(a) that the ground in section 92(3)(a) or (4)(a) (as the case may be) applies
in relation to the service,
(b) as to the ground in subsection (1)(b)(i) or (ii),
(c) that the person provides an access facility in relation to the relevant
service,
(d) that there are prima facie grounds to suggest that an application for an
access restriction order under section 93 would be successful,
(e) that the level of risk of harm to individuals in the United Kingdom
relating to the likely failure, and the nature and severity of that harm,
are such that it is not appropriate to wait for the failure to be established
before making the order, and
(f) if no notice of the application has been given to the non-compliant
provider, or to the persons on whom requirements are being imposed,
that it is appropriate to make the order without notice.


(5) An interim access restriction order ceases to have effect on the earlier of—
(a) the date specified in the order, or the date on which the time period
specified in the order expires (as the case may be), or
(b) the date on which the court makes an access restriction order under
section 93 in relation to the relevant service that imposes requirements
on the same persons on whom requirements are imposed by the
interim order, or dismisses an application for such an order.


(6) Subsections (5) to (8) of section 93 apply in relation to an interim access
restriction order under this section as they apply in relation to an access
restriction order under that section.


(7) Where a person who provides an access facility takes steps or puts in place
arrangements required by an interim access restriction order, OFCOM may, by
notice, require that person to (where possible) notify persons in the United

Kingdom who attempt to access the relevant service via that facility of the
interim access restriction order.


(8) In this section, “access facility” and “the court” have the same meaning as in
section 93 (see subsections (10), (11) and (12) of that section).

**95 Interaction with other action by OFCOM**


(1) Where OFCOM apply for a business disruption order in respect of a failure by
a provider of a regulated service to comply with an enforceable requirement
referred to in section 82, nothing in sections 91 to 94 is to be taken to prevent
OFCOM also giving the provider—
(a) a confirmation decision in respect of the failure, or
(b) a penalty notice under section 84(3) in relation to a confirmation
decision in respect of the failure.


(2) Where OFCOM apply for a business disruption order in respect of a failure by
a provider of a regulated service to comply with a use of technology notice
under section 64, 65 or 67, nothing in sections 91 to 94 is to be taken to prevent
OFCOM also giving the provider a further use of technology notice under
section 67.


(3) In this section, a “business disruption order” means—
(a) a service restriction order under section 91,
(b) an interim service restriction order under section 92,
(c) an access restriction order under section 93, or
(d) an interim access restriction order under section 94.

(c) given a penalty notice under section 89;
(d) given a penalty notice under section 90.


(2) OFCOM must publish details identifying the person and describing—
(a) the action that has been taken, and
(b) the failure (or failures) to which that action relates.


(3) But OFCOM may not publish anything that, in OFCOM’s opinion—
(a) is commercially sensitive, or
(b) is otherwise not appropriate for publication.


(4) Where OFCOM have given a person a provisional notice of enforcement action
but have taken no enforcement action against the person, OFCOM may publish
details identifying the person and describing the reasons for the provisional
notice.


(5) OFCOM must notify the person concerned that information has been
published under this section.
(6) Publication under this section may be in any manner that OFCOM consider
appropriate.


Guidance

**97 Guidance about enforcement action**


(1) OFCOM must prepare guidance about how OFCOM propose to exercise their
functions under this Chapter.


(2) The guidance must, in particular, give information about the factors that
OFCOM would consider it appropriate to take into account when taking, or
considering taking, enforcement action relating to a person’s failure to comply
with the enforceable requirements referred to in each paragraph of section 82.


(3) In relation to any enforcement action by OFCOM which relates to a failure by
a provider of a regulated service to comply with a relevant duty, the guidance
must include provision explaining how OFCOM will take into account the
impact (or possible impact) of such a failure on children.


(4) Before preparing guidance under this section (including revised or
replacement guidance), OFCOM must consult—
(a) the Secretary of State, and
(b) such other persons as OFCOM consider appropriate.


(5) OFCOM must publish the guidance (and any revised or replacement
guidance).


(6) Guidelines prepared by OFCOM under section 392 of the Communications Act
(amount of penalties) may, so far as relating to penalties imposed under this
Chapter, be included in the same document as guidance under this section.


(7) In exercising their functions under this Chapter, or deciding whether to
exercise them, OFCOM must have regard to the guidance for the time being in
force under this section.


(8) In this section, a “relevant duty” means—

#### EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR THIS SECTION

Chapter 6: Enforcement Powers

Provisional notices and confirmation decisions

Clause 80: Provisional notice of enforcement action

Subsection (1) states that OFCOM may give a person notice that OFCOM
intends to take enforcement action, through issuing a provisional notice of
enforcement action to that person.
Subsection (2) states that (subject to the limitation in respect of prevalent and
persistent terrorism or child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) content set out in
clause 81) OFCOM may issue a provisional notice of enforcement action to a
provider of a regulated service if OFCOM considers there are reasonable grounds for
believing that a provider of a regulated service has failed, or is failing to comply, with
any of the ‘enforceable requirements’ listed in clause 82.
In addition, subsections (3) and (4) provide that OFCOM may issue a
provisional notice of enforcement action to a person if OFCOM reasonably consider
that the person is failing to comply with their duties under an information notice
issued to them under clause 70, or OFCOM reasonably consider that the person has
not rendered the assistance which it is required to give to a skilled person under
clause 74.
Subsection (5) specifies that the provisional notice of enforcement action
must specify the duty or requirement that OFCOM considers the person has
breached, OFCOM’s reasons for holding that opinion, and the steps OFCOM
considers the person needs to take to comply with the relevant duty or requirement,
or to remedy the breach.
Subsection (6) provides that the provisional notice of enforcement action may
further state that OFCOM proposes to impose a penalty on the person and, if it does,
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
the notice must state OFCOM’s reasons for proposing a penalty and the amount of
penalty OFCOM propose, detailing any aggravating or mitigating factors they
propose to consider in determining the final amount of the penalty.
Subsection (7) states that a provisional notice of enforcement action must
state that the person who receives the notice may make written representations on
the matters contained within the notice and the notice must specify the period within
which such representations may be made.
Subsection (8) provides that a provisional notice of enforcement action may
be given in respect of a breach of multiple enforceable requirements set out in clause
Subsection (9) provides that, in the case of a continuing breach of a relevant
duty or enforceable requirement, a provisional notice of enforcement action may be
issued in respect of any period of time during which the breach was occurring. The
notice must specify the period of time which it is concerned with.
Subsection (10) states that where a provisional notice of enforcement action
is issued to a person (the first notice), OFCOM may only issue a further provisional
notice of enforcement action in respect of a breach of the same duty or requirement
if: it relates to a separate breach occurring after the first notice was issued; the first
notice dealt with a continuous breach and the further notice arises out of a
continuation of the breach after the end of the period of breach specified in the first
notice; or the first notice has been withdrawn without OFCOM imposing a penalty via
the issuing of a confirmation decision.
Clause 81: Prevalent and persistent terrorism or child sexual exploitation and abuse content

Subsection (1) explains that this clause applies where OFCOM reasonably
considers that a provider of a regulated user-to-user or search service is failing to
comply with its safety duties relating to illegal content (as set out in clause 9) in
relation to terrorism or CSEA content, based on evidence demonstrating the
prevalence and persistence of terrorism and/or CSEA content on the service or in the
search results of the service.
Subsection (2) states that OFCOM may not give a provider of a regulated
user-to-user service a provisional notice of enforcement action under clause 80 if the
provider is complying with all the other enforceable requirements listed in clause 82.
Subsection (4) makes it clear, however, that in such circumstances, it would be open
to OFCOM to take action in respect of the provider’s breaches of its safety duties
relating to illegal content (under clause 9) in relation to terrorism or CSEA content by
issuing the provider with a technology warning notice under clause 63.
Nonetheless, should OFCOM be of the opinion that there are reasonable
grounds for believing that a provider who is failing to comply with its illegal content
safety duties with respect to terrorism or CSEA content is also in breach of one of the
other enforceable requirements listed in clause 82, OFCOM may issue a provisional
notice of enforcement action in relation to this breach of another enforceable
requirement. Subsection (5) makes it clear that, in these circumstances, OFCOM is
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
able to impose both a technology warning notice under clause 63 and a provisional
notice of enforcement action.
Clause 82: Requirements enforceable by OFCOM against providers of regulated services

Under clause 80, OFCOM may give a provisional notice of enforcement
action to a provider of a regulated service if OFCOM believes that the provider has
failed, or is failing to comply with, any “enforceable requirement”. OFCOM may then
impose a confirmation decision under clause 83 in respect of the failure to comply
with an enforceable requirement. This clause sets out the “enforceable requirements”
referred to in clauses 80 and 83. By way of example, these include, among other
things, the duties to carry out and report on risk assessments, the safety duties and
duties about rights to freedom of expression and privacy.
Clause 83: Confirmation decisions

As set out in clause 80, OFCOM may give a provisional notice of enforcement
action to a provider of a regulated service if it believes that that the provider has
failed, or is failing to comply with any “enforceable requirement” or is breaching a
relevant duty relating to information notices or skilled persons’ reports. This
provisional notice of enforcement action is referred to as a “notified requirement”.
This clause sets out how OFCOM can subsequently issue a confirmation decision.
A confirmation decision is a formal notification that the relevant person has
failed or is still failing to comply with a notified requirement (set out in the provisional
notice of enforcement) and the period allowed for representations has expired: see
subsection (1). A confirmation decision can include a notice imposing requirements
for the provider to take steps to comply with a notified requirement and/or to pay a
penalty: see subsection (3) and (4).
Subsection (5) details the circumstances in which a confirmation decision
may require a person to either take steps to comply with a notified requirement or to
remedy the failure.
Subsection (6) states the circumstances in which a confirmation decision may
require the person to pay a penalty, of an amount specified by OFCOM.
Subsection (7) sets out that, where a confirmation decision includes
requirements to comply or remedy the failure, then it must:
a. give OFCOM’s reasoning for the requirements it is imposing and specify the
notified requirement;
b. require the person to comply with the notified requirement, or remedy the
failure, specifying the time period for that action; and
c. detail the rights of appeal, and set out the consequences of non-compliance.
This could include further information about the further kinds of enforcement
action that OFCOM could take.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (8) sets out that where a confirmation decision includes a
requirement to pay a penalty, then it must:
a. give OFCOM’s reasoning for its decision and specify the notified requirement;
b. state the reasons for the amount of the penalty, and how and when it should
be paid; and
c. detail the rights of appeal, and set out the consequences of not paying the
penalty. This could include further information about the further kinds of
enforcement action that OFCOM could take.
Subsection (10) states that a confirmation decision may only impose
requirements in relation to regulated services in the UK or regulated services that
affect users in the UK.
Subsection (11) states that a confirmation decision may not impose a
requirement to use technology to monitor content with a view to taking down such
content or removing such content from search results (as appropriate).
Subsection (12) provides that a confirmation decision may impose separate
penalties for failure to comply with separate notified requirements but where a
provisional notice of enforcement action is given in respect of a period of continuing
failure, then only one penalty may be imposed in respect of that period: see
subsection (13). However, subsection (14) states that OFCOM can impose a daily
penalty where a confirmation decision imposes requirements in respect of ongoing
failures. This can be imposed after a period specified in the confirmation decision
(which will allow the relevant service provider the opportunity to come into
compliance first).
Clause 84: Compliance with certain requirements of confirmation decisions

This clause sets out how a person should comply with the requirements
specified in a confirmation decision.
Subsection (1) states that the recipient of a confirmation decision has a duty
to comply with a requirement set out in the confirmation decision to take steps to
remedy a breach which has been the subject of a provisional notice of enforcement
action. OFCOM may enforce compliance with this duty in civil proceedings by virtue
of subsection (2).
Subsection (3) states that OFCOM may issue a person with penalty notice if it
is satisfied that the person has not complied with a requirement in a confirmation
decision to take steps to remedy a breach which has been the subject of a
provisional notice of enforcement action. Subsection (4) notes that, for the purposes
of this clause, a penalty notice is a notice which requires the recipient to pay OFCOM
a penalty of an amount in sterling which is specified in the notice.
Subsection (5) states that a penalty notice must:
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
a. give OFCOM’s reasoning for their decision to issue a penalty notice and state
the reasons for the amount of the penalty;
b. specify how and when the penalty should be paid (noting that, by virtue of
subsection (6) the period within which the penalty must be paid cannot be
less than 28 days); and
c. detail the rights of appeal, and set out the consequences of not paying the
penalty. This could include information about the further kinds of enforcement
action that OFCOM could take.
Clause 85: Amount of penalties

As set out in clauses 83 and 84 the regulator will be able to impose penalties
in a confirmation decision or a penalty notice: see subsection (1). This clause sets
out the amount of a penalty that can be imposed on a person in such notices.
Subsection (2) sets out the things that OFCOM will need to take into account
when determining the size of the penalty. This includes any representations made by
the person or evidence provided by the person, any steps taken by the person to
comply with the requirements set out in the provisional notice of enforcement action
or confirmation decision, any steps taken to remedy the failure and the effects of the
failure in respect of which the penalty is being imposed. Subsection (3) states that
OFCOM must impose a penalty that it considers to be appropriate and proportionate
to the failure (or failures) in respect of which the penalty is imposed.
Subsection (4) states that the maximum penalty that OFCOM can impose on
the provider of a regulated service is the greater of £18 million and 10% of the
person’s qualifying worldwide revenue. Subsection (5) means that if the person does
not have a clear accounting period the maximum penalty OFCOM can impose is £18
million. Subsection (6) states that the maximum penalty OFCOM can impose on
other persons (not regulated service providers) is £18 million. These provisions also
apply to determine the total maximum amount of daily penalties that may be imposed
by OFCOM in a confirmation decision: see subsection (11).
Subsection (7) includes further detail on how “qualifying worldwide revenue”
will be calculated for the purposes of subsection 4(b) of this clause. For example, if
the duration of the most recent complete accounting year is less than a year, then the
amount should be proportionately increased: see subsection (8). Further, if the
duration of the most recent accounting year is longer than a year, then the amount
should be proportionately decreased. The term “qualifying worldwide revenue” will be
defined in regulations made by the Secretary of State (see subsection (14)) following
consultation with OFCOM (see subsection 15).
Subsection (9) provides that where the qualifying worldwide revenue for an
accounting period cannot be agreed between the individual and OFCOM, then
OFCOM will determine the amount.
Subsection (10) confirms that a penalty imposed by a confirmation decision
clause 83 may not exceed the amount of the penalty that was initially proposed in the
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
provisional notice of enforcement action given to the provider of the regulated service
clause 80.
Subsection (11) confirms that the total maximum amount of daily penalties
imposed by OFCOM under clause 83(14) will be determined in the same way as the
maximum amount of the penalties set out in subsections (4) to (6) of clause 85.
Subsection (12) refers to Section 392 of the Communications Act 2003, which
requires OFCOM to produce guidelines setting out how they determine penalty
amounts.
Subsection (13) states that “accounting period” means a period in which a
person is required to prepare accounts (by law or by the constitution of the entity)
either in respect of the entity or in respect of the individual’s business of providing a
regulated service (as appropriate).
Clause 86: Amount of penalties: group of entities

This clause applies where two entities are jointly liable for a penalty imposed
by a confirmation decision or a penalty notice. This may occur where OFCOM deems
a parent company jointly liable for the breach of its subsidiary (as per clause 119), or
where OFCOM deems a subsidiary company to be jointly liable for the breach of its
fellow subsidiary or parent company (as per clause 121). This clause sets out how
penalties are to be calculated in such a scenario.
Subsection (3) states that the maximum amount of the penalty in such cases
is the greater of £18 million and 10% of the “qualifying worldwide revenue” of the
group of entities of which the two entities are members.
Subsection (4) defines the “qualifying worldwide revenue” for a group of
entities as the amount of the group’s qualifying worldwide revenue for the most
recent complete accounting period of the liable entities or, if OFCOM are deciding the
amount of the penalty at a time when the first accounting period has not ended yet,
the amount that OFCOM estimate to be the group’s likely qualifying worldwide
revenue for that period.
Subsection (5) provides for circumstances where the accounting periods of
the liable entities within a group are different. In such circumstances, OFCOM can
decide which entity or entities’ accounting period to use for the purposes of
calculating the “qualifying worldwide revenue”.
Subsection (7) states that “qualifying worldwide revenue” has the same
meaning as in clause 85, i.e. it will be defined in regulations made by the Secretary of
State following consultation with OFCOM. The regulations may include details for
applying this term to a group of entities.
Subsection (9) confirms that for the purposes of this clause, section 1162 and
Schedule 7 to the Companies Act 2006 should be read with the relevant
modifications, if it is to be applied to an entity outside of the United Kingdom.
Clause 87: Penalties: further provision

These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
This clause sets out how payment of penalties can be enforced.
Subsection (2) sets out that in England and Wales, a penalty can be
recovered if the county court or High Court orders payment.
Subsection (3) confirms that in Scotland, a penalty can be enforced in the
same way as an extract registered decree arbitrarily bearing a warrant for execution,
that would be issued by the sheriff court.
Subsection (4) sets out that in Northern Ireland, a penalty can be recovered if
the county court or High Court orders payment.
Non-payment of fee

Clause 88: Notice about non-payment of fee

Clause 52 explains where OFCOM may require a provider of a regulated
service to pay a fee. This clause sets out OFCOM’s power to issue a notice where a
provider of a regulated service does not pay its fee to OFCOM.
Subsection (1) confirms that OFCOM can give a notice to a provider of a
regulated service where they are liable to pay a fee and OFCOM believes that they
have not paid the full amount.
Subsection (2) states that OFCOM must specify the outstanding amount and
specify a period within which it should be paid. Subsection (3) provides that the
notice must invite written representations from the provider within a specified
timeframe. One notice may be given in respect of more than one liability to pay a fee:
see subsection (4).
Clause 89: Penalty notice for non-payment of fee

This clause sets out the circumstances under which OFCOM can give a
provider a penalty notice for not paying a fee.
Subsection (1) states that a penalty notice can be given under this section, if
following a notice specifying the outstanding amount of fee to be paid (as per clause
88), the period for the provider giving representations has expired and OFCOM is
satisfied that the fee has still not been paid to them.
Subsection (3) sets out what OFCOM must take into account when
determining the penalty fee and subsection (4) provides for further detail on what the
penalty notice should include such as the amount of the fee, the reasons for giving a
penalty notice and the time period for paying it.
Subsection (7) makes clear that the definitions set out at clause 85(3) to (9)
and the provisions at clause 86 and clause 87 also apply in relation to this clause.
Subsection (8) makes clear that this clause does not impact OFCOM’s power
to bring proceedings for the recovery of the amount due to OFCOM. However, as set
out in subsection (9), they must not bring such proceedings until the provider has
been notified of how much is due to be paid (clause 88).
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Non-compliance with use of technology notice

Clause 90: Penalty notice for failure to comply with use of technology notice

Subsections (1) and (2) states OFCOM may give a service provider a penalty
notice requiring it to pay a penalty, if OFCOM has given a service provider a use of
technology notice under clause 64, 65 or 67 relating to a regulated service and
OFCOM is satisfied that, at any time during which the notice is in force, the provider
is failing to comply with the notice.
Subsection (3) sets out that before OFCOM can issue the penalty notice,
OFCOM must notify the provider that they intend to give a penalty notice under this
section, specifying the grounds for doing so and indicating the amount of the
proposed penalty. OFCOM must give the provider an opportunity to make
representations, consider any representations made together with any steps taken by
the provider towards complying with the use of technology notice.
Subsection (4) notes that nothing in this section prevents OFCOM from also
giving the provider a further use of technology notice under clause 67 in addition to
issuing a penalty notice.
Subsection (5) sets out the information that the penalty notice must contain,
including (a) OFCOM’s reasons for its decision to give the penalty notice; (b) the
reasons for the amount of the penalty; (c) specifying the period within which the
penalty must be paid and (d) the rights of appeal of such a notice.
575. Subsection (6) sets out that the period specified under subsection (5)(c) must
be not less than 28 days beginning with the day on which the penalty notice is given.
Subsection (7) states that the final penalty imposed must not be greater than the
amount proposed in the notice under subsection (3).
Subsection (8) states that a penalty issued to a provider of a regulated
service under this clause must be appropriate and proportionate (clause 85 (3)) and
no more than either £18 million or 10% of the provider’s or relevant group of entities’
qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever is greater.
Business disruption measures

Clause 91: Service restriction orders

This clause sets out the circumstances in which OFCOM may apply to the
court for a “service restriction order”. These are orders that require providers of
“ancillary services” (persons providing, for example, payment or advertising services)
to implement measures aimed at disrupting the business of a non-compliant
provider’s operations in the UK.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)

This clause sets out the circumstances in which OFCOM may apply to the
court for a “service restriction order”. These are orders that require providers of
“ancillary services” (persons providing, for example, payment or advertising services)
to implement measures aimed at disrupting the business of a non-compliant
provider’s operations in the UK.
Subsection (1) confers a power on OFCOM to apply to the court for a service
restriction order where it considers that the grounds in subsection (3) or (4) apply in
relation to a regulated service (as explained below).
Subsection (2) provides a definition of a “service restriction order”. This is
defined as an order imposing requirements on persons who provide an ancillary
service to a regulated service.
Subsection (3) specifies the first set of grounds on which OFCOM may seek a
service restriction order. These grounds are that OFCOM considers that a provider of
a regulated service has failed to comply with an enforceable requirement (these are
set out in clause 82 and include, for example, safety duties about illegal content and
safety duties protecting children), this failure is continuing, and the provider has
either:
a. failed to comply with a requirement imposed by a confirmation decision (see
clause 83), or
b. failed to pay a penalty imposed by a confirmation decision (see clause 83)
relating to the failure (and the confirmation decision did not impose any
requirements on the provider), or
c. the provider would be likely to fail to comply with a confirmation decision if
given, or the risk of harm to individuals in the UK means it is appropriate to
apply for a service restriction order without having given a provisional notice
of enforcement or a confirmation decision. For example, for expediency
where the risk of harm is so severe.
Subsection (4) specifies the second set of grounds on which OFCOM may
seek a service restriction order. These grounds are that OFCOM considers that a
provider of a regulated service has failed to comply with a use of technology notice
(under clause 64, 65 or 67), and the failure is continuing.
Subsection (5) sets out what information an application by OFCOM to the
court for a service restriction order must include. The requirements are that an
application must:
a. Specify the regulated service in relation to which the application is made,
specify the provider of that regulated service and contain evidence that the
grounds in subsection (3) or (4) are met, and
b. Specify the persons on whom OFCOM considers the requirements of the
order should be imposed, contain evidence for why OFCOM considers these
persons provide an ancillary service, specify what this ancillary service is and
detail the requirements that OFCOM considers should be imposed on these
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)

persons. Where OFCOM has not given notice to the non-compliant provider
or relevant ancillary services, it must state why no notice has been given.
Subsection (6) specifies what the court must be satisfied of before it may
make a service restriction order imposing requirements on a person. The court must
be satisfied that the grounds in subsection (3) or (4) are met; that is, that the person
in question provides an ancillary service and that the making of such an order is
appropriate for preventing harm to individuals in the UK. Where OFCOM is seeking
to argue that a provider would be likely to fail to comply with a confirmation decision if
one were given, or the circumstances of the failure mean it is appropriate to apply for
a service restriction order without giving a confirmation decision, the court must also
be satisfied that it is appropriate to make a service restriction order before a
provisional notice of enforcement or a confirmation decision. Where no notice of the
application has been given to the non-compliant provider or the person(s) on whom
requirements are being imposed (e.g. where OFCOM cannot contact them), the court
must also be satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order without notice).
Subsection (7) sets out further matters that the court must take into account
when considering whether to make a service restriction order and when considering
what provision the order should contain. The court must take into account the rights
and obligations of all relevant parties, including those of the non-compliant provider,
UK users of the relevant service, and providers of an ancillary service on whom the
court is considering imposing the requirements.
Subsection (8) sets out what information a service restriction order must
include. This includes the identity of the non-compliant provider, the identity of the
ancillary service provider on whom the requirements are imposed and the ancillary
service(s) to which the requirements relate, the steps to be taken in order to withdraw
the ancillary service from the non-compliant provider, the date by which the
requirements must be complied with and the date on which the order expires or the
time period for which the order has effect.
Subsection (9) states that a service restriction order may specify steps or
arrangements that could require the termination of an agreement or prohibit the
performance of such an agreement. This would in effect mean the ancillary service
provider is not obliged to fulfil its contractual obligations under its agreement with the
regulated provider. It is irrelevant whether the agreement was made before the
coming into force of this section. Subsection (9)(b) states that these steps or
arrangements should be limited so far as possible to the operations of the relevant
service as it affects users who are in the UK.
Subsection (10) imposes an obligation on OFCOM to inform the Secretary of
State of any service restriction order as soon as reasonably possible after the order
has been made by the court.
Subsection (11) defines an “ancillary service” as one that facilitates the
provision of a regulated service or part of it (whether directly or indirectly) or displays
content relating to that service or part of it.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (12) provides a non-exhaustive list of ancillary services. This list
includes payment service providers, search engines, user to user services which
make content relating to a regulated service available to users (which could cover
social media platforms) and advertising services (such as ad servers or ad networks).
Subsection (13) defines “the court” for the purposes of this clause. For
England and Wales this is the High Court or the county court, for Northern Ireland the
High Court or county court, and for Scotland the Court of Session or a sheriff.
Clause 92: Interim service restriction orders

This clause sets out the circumstances in which OFCOM may apply to the
courts for an interim service restriction order.
Subsection (1) confers a power on OFCOM to apply to the court for an interim
service restriction order in relation to a regulated service where it considers that the
grounds in (3) or (4) apply to the service.
Subsection (2) defines an “interim service restriction order”. This is defined as
an interim order imposing requirements on one or more persons who provide an
ancillary service in relation to a regulated service.
Subsection (3) specifies the first set of grounds on which OFCOM may seek
an interim service restriction order. These grounds are that OFCOM considers it to
be likely that the provider of a regulated service is failing to comply with an
enforceable requirement (set out in clause 82) and the level of risk of harm to UK
users resulting from this likely failure, and the nature and severity of that harm, mean
that it would not be appropriate to establish the failure before applying for the order.
Subsection (4) sets out further grounds on which OFCOM may seek an
interim service restriction order. These grounds are that it is likely that a provider of a
regulated service is failing to comply with a use of technology notice (see clause 64,
65 or 67) and the level of risk of harm to individuals in the UK resulting from this likely
failure, and the nature and severity of that harm, are such that it would not be
appropriate to establish the failure before applying for the order.
Subsection (5) sets out what information must be included in an application to
the court by OFCOM for an interim service restriction order. The application must:
a. Specify the regulated service in relation to which the application is made, the
provider of that service and contain evidence that either grounds in
subsections (3) or (4) are met, and;
b. Specify the persons on whom, in OFCOM’s opinion, the requirements of the
order should be imposed, contain evidence that these persons provide an
ancillary service in relation to the relevant service, specify what this ancillary
service is and contain details of the requirements OFCOM considers the
order should impose on these persons.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
c. If an application has been made without giving notice to the non-compliant
provider or the ancillary service provider, set out why no notice has been
given.
Subsection (6) sets out what the court must be satisfied of before it can
proceed to issue an interim service restriction order. The court must be satisfied that
the grounds in either subsection (3) or (4) are met and that the person on whom the
order will be imposed provides an ancillary service, and that there are prima facie
grounds why an application for a service restriction order under clause 91 would be
successful. The court must also be satisfied that the risk of harm to UK individuals,
and the nature and severity of that harm, mean it would not be appropriate to wait for
the failure to be established before making the order and, if no notice has been
given, that it is appropriate to make an interim order without notice.
Subsection (6) sets out what the court must be satisfied of before it can
proceed to issue an interim service restriction order. The court must be satisfied that
the grounds in either subsection (3) or (4) are met and that the person on whom the
order will be imposed provides an ancillary service, and that there are prima facie
grounds why an application for a service restriction order under clause 91 would be
successful. The court must also be satisfied that the risk of harm to UK individuals,
and the nature and severity of that harm, mean it would not be appropriate to wait for
the failure to be established before making the order and, if no notice has been
given, that it is appropriate to make an interim order without notice.
Subsection (7) provides that an interim service restriction order will cease to
have effect on the earlier of either the date specified in the order (or the date on
which the time period specified in the order expires), or the date on which the court
makes a service restriction order under clause 91 that imposes requirements on the
persons who are subject to the interim service restriction order (or dismisses the
application for such an order).
Subsection (8) provides that subsections (7) to (10) of clause 91 apply to the
making of interim service restriction orders. (For example, these subsections require
the court to consider the rights and obligations of parties to the order, set out what
information an order must contain, that the steps required by an order can include
steps that could require the termination of an agreement and that the Secretary of
State must be informed of the making of an order).
Subsection (9) provides that “ancillary service” and “the court” are defined in
the same way as in clause 91.
Clause 93: Access restriction orders

This clause sets out the circumstances in which OFCOM may apply to the
courts for an “access restriction order”. An access restriction order can require third
parties who provide an “access facility” to take steps to impede access to a non-
compliant regulated service. Access restriction orders seek to impede the operation
of a regulated service by preventing, restricting or deterring individuals in the UK from
accessing that service.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)

Subsection (1) confers a power on OFCOM to apply to the court for an
access restriction order where it considers that the grounds in clause 91(3) or clause
91(4) apply. These are where the provider:
a. has failed to comply with a requirement imposed by a confirmation decision
(see clause 83), or failed to pay a penalty imposed by a confirmation decision
(see clause 83) relating to the failure (and the confirmation decision did not
impose any requirements on the provider); or
b. would be likely to fail to comply with a confirmation decision if given, or the
risk of harm to individuals in the UK means it is appropriate to apply for a
service restriction order without having given a provisional notice of
enforcement action or confirmation decision (for example, for expediency
where the risk of harm is so severe); or
c. has failed to comply with a use of technology notice (under clause 64, 65 or
67), and the failure is continuing.
d. OFCOM must also consider that either (i) a service restriction order issued
under clause 91 or an interim service restriction order issued under clause 92
is not sufficient to prevent significant harm to individuals in the UK, or (ii) the
likely consequences of such a failure are such that they would be unlikely to
be sufficient to prevent significant harm to individuals in the UK.
Subsection (2) defines an “access restriction order”. This is defined as an
order imposing requirements on one or more persons who provide an “access
facility” in relation to a regulated service. Subsection (10) defines an “access facility”
for the purposes of this clause. This is defined as a facility that can be withdrawn,
adapted or manipulated by the provider of the facility in a way that impedes access
by UK users to the relevant service. Subsection (11) provides a non-exhaustive list of
access facilities, including internet access services and app stores.
Subsection (3) specifies what information an application to the court for an
access restriction order by OFCOM must include. The application must:
a. Specify the regulated service about which the application is made, the
provider of that service and specify the grounds on which the application is
made and contain evidence of those grounds.
b. Specify the persons on whom the requirements of the order should be
imposed, contain evidence for why OFCOM considers these persons provide
an access facility and specify what this access facility is, and contain details
of the requirements OFCOM thinks should be imposed on these persons.
c. If an application has been made without giving notice to the non-compliant
provider or the person(s) providing an access facility, set out why no notice
has been given.
Subsection (4) specifies what the court must be satisfied of before it may
make an access restriction order imposing requirements on a person. The court must
be satisfied that the grounds in subsection (1) are met, that the person provides an
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
access facility and that the making of this order is appropriate for preventing harm to
individuals in the UK. If an access restriction will be imposed before a provisional
notice of enforcement action or confirmation decision is given, the court must also be
satisfied that this is appropriate and, if no notice has been given, that it is appropriate
to make an interim order without notice.
Subsection (5) specifies that the court must take into account the rights and
obligations of all relevant parties when considering whether to make an access
restriction order and what provision it should contain. This includes the rights and
obligations of the non-compliant provider, the persons providing an access facility
and UK users of the relevant service.
Subsection (6) specifies what information an access restriction order must
contain. This information includes the identity of the non-compliant provider, the
identity of the persons providing an access facility on whom the requirements are
imposed, and the steps to be taken, or arrangements to be put in place, in order to
impede user access to the relevant service. The order must also specify the date by
which the order must be complied with and the date on which it expires (or the time
period over which the order has effect).
Subsection (7) provides that an access restriction order may include steps or
arrangements that require the termination of an agreement or prohibit the
performance of such an agreement. It is irrelevant whether the agreement was made
before the coming into force of this section. Subsection (7)(b) states that these steps
or arrangements are to be limited, so far as possible, to only impede the access of
UK users of the relevant service and subsection (7)(c) states that they should not
affect UK users’ ability to access other internet services, so far as this is possible.
Subsection (8) imposes an obligation on OFCOM to inform the Secretary of
State of any access restriction order as soon as reasonably possible after the order
has been made.
Subsection (9) provides that OFCOM may require providers of access
facilities to notify their users who attempt to access the relevant service that an
access restriction order is in place (and refer to the relevant confirmation decision, if
the order was made on the basis that the provider has failed to comply with a
requirement imposed by a confirmation decision under clause 83).
Subsection (12) defines “the court”, “facility” and “internet access service” for
the purposes of this clause. “The court” is defined as, for England and Wales the
High Court or the county court, for Northern Ireland the High Court or county court,
and for Scotland the Court of Session or a sheriff. “Facility” is defined as any service,
infrastructure or apparatus that enables users to access a regulated service. “Internet
access service” is defined as a service that provides access to virtually all of the end
points of the internet (e.g. ISPs).
Clause 94: Interim access restriction orders

This clause sets out the circumstances in which OFCOM may apply to the
courts for an interim access restriction order.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)

Subsection (1) confers a power on OFCOM to apply to the court for an interim
access restriction order where it considers that the grounds in (a) and (b) are met.
First, (a) requires the grounds in subsection clause 92(3) or (4) to apply. These are
the same as listed above under clause 91, namely where the provider:
a. has failed to comply with a requirement imposed by a confirmation decision
(see clause 82), or failed to pay a penalty imposed by a confirmation decision
(see clause 82) relating to the failure (and the confirmation decision did not
impose any requirements on the provider), or
b. would be likely to fail to comply with a confirmation decision if given, or the
risk of harm to individuals in the UK means it is appropriate to apply for a
service restriction order without having given a provisional notice of
enforcement action or a confirmation decision (for example, for expediency
where the risk of harm is so severe), or
c. has failed to comply with a use of technology notice (under clause 64, 65 or
67), and the failure is continuing.
Second, (b) requires OFCOM to also be satisfied that either:
a. an interim service restriction order or service restriction order was imposed
and was not sufficient to prevent significant harm to UK users arising from the
breach, or
b. in all circumstances, imposing an interim service restriction order or service
restriction order would be unlikely to prevent significant harm to UK users
arising from the breach.
Subsection (2) defines an “interim service restriction order” as an interim
order imposing requirements on persons who provide an access facility in relation to
a regulated service.
Subsection (3) specifies that an application to the court for an interim access
restriction order by OFCOM must:
a. Specify the regulated service, the provider of that service and specify the
grounds on which the application is based and contain evidence of such
grounds; and
b. Specify the persons on whom the requirements of the order should be
imposed, contain evidence that these persons provide an access facility,
specify what this access facility is and contain details of the requirements that
OFCOM considers should be imposed on these persons. If no notice has
been given to the non-compliant provider or the provider of an access facility,
state why no notice was given.
Subsection (4) specifies what the court must be satisfied of before it may
make an interim access restriction order imposing requirements on a person. The
court must be satisfied that the grounds in subsection 92(3)(a) or (4)(a) are met, as to
the ground in subsection (1)(b)(i) or (ii) (as the case may be), that the person in
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
question provides an access facility, that there are prima facie grounds why an
application for an access restriction order under clause 93 would be successful, and
that the level of risk of harm to individuals in the UK makes it appropriate not to wait
for the failure to be established before making the order. If no notice of the
application has been given, the court must also be satisfied that it is appropriate to
make an interim order without notice.
Subsection (5) specifies that an interim access restriction order will cease to
have effect on whichever is earlier of: (i) the date specified in the order, or (ii) the
date on which the court makes an access restriction order under clause 93 that
imposes requirements on the same persons (or dismisses the application for such an
order).
Subsection (6) provides that subsection (5) to (8) of clause 93 apply to the
making of an access restriction order. For example, these subsections require the
court to consider the rights and obligations of parties to the order, set out what
information an order must contain, that the steps required by an order can include
steps that could require the termination of an agreement, and that the Secretary of
State must be informed of the making of an order.
Subsection (7) provides that OFCOM may require providers of access
facilities to notify their UK users who attempt to access the relevant service that an
access restriction order is in place.
Subsection (8) provides that for the purposes of this clause, “access facility”
and “the court” have the same meaning as in clause 93.
Clause 95: Interaction with other action by OFCOM

This clause explains how business disruption orders interact with OFCOM’s
other enforcement powers.
Subsection (1) explains that, where OFCOM exercises its powers to apply to
the courts for business disruption orders under clauses 91 to 94 in respect of a
providers’ failure to comply with an enforceable requirement (clause 82), it is not
precluded from also issuing the relevant regulated provider with either a confirmation
decision under clause 83 or a penalty notice under clause 84.
Subsection (2) explains that, where OFCOM exercises its powers to apply for
business disruption orders under clauses 91 to 94 in respect of a providers’ failure to
comply with a Use of Technology Notice under clauses 64, 65 or 67, it is not
precluded from also issuing a Further Use of Technology Notice under clause 67.
Publication of enforcement action

Clause 96: Publication of details of enforcement action

Where OFCOM has taken enforcement action, it may publish the details of
this enforcement action. This is to provide transparency to industry on OFCOM’s
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
enforcement activities. This clause sets out where this will apply and how OFCOM
must act.
Subsection (1) states that this applies where a confirmation decision, penalty
notice, service restriction notice, or an access restriction notice have been issued.
Subsections (2) and (3) state that OFCOM must publish details identifying the
person and the failure that the enforcement action relates to, and the action that has
been taken. However, commercially sensitive data, or content that OFCOM believes
is not appropriate for publication, should not be published.
Where OFCOM has given a person a provisional notice of enforcement action
under clause 80 but taking no enforcement action against the person, OFCOM may
publish details identifying the person and describing the reasons for the provisional
notice: see subsection (4).
Guidance

Clause 97: Guidance about enforcement action

OFCOM must publish guidance about how it will use its enforcement powers.
Subsection (2) confirms that the guidance should give information about the
factors OFCOM will take into account when taking or considering enforcement action.
This enforcement action will relate to the failure to comply with the “enforceable
requirements” set out in clause 82. Subsection (3) adds that the guidance must
include how OFCOM will take into account the possible or actual impact of such a
failure to comply with a relevant duty on children.
Before producing the guidance, OFCOM must consult with the Secretary of
State and any persons OFCOM considers appropriate: see subsection (4). OFCOM
may revise and replace the guidance and must also publish the guidance: see
subsection (5).
Subsection (6) confirms that guidance prepared by OFCOM under Section
392 of the Communications Act 2003, relating to penalties imposed, can be included
within the guidance required by this clause.
Subsection (7) states that when exercising, or deciding to exercise their
enforcement functions, OFCOM must have regard to the guidance it has produced.

Power exercised by: Regulations
Parliamentary procedure: Affirmative

Context and purpose

OFCOM will have a suite of enforcement powers available to use against providers of
regulated services who fail to comply with ‘enforceable requirements’ (see clause 82)
such as duties to carry out risk assessments or safety duties about illegal content,
and protecting children or adults from harmful content. One of those powers will be for
OFCOM to impose financial penalties on providers who have failed, or are continuing
to fail, to comply with their statutory obligations.
Where a penalty is imposed on a person in respect of a regulated service provided by
that person, the maximum amount of the penalty that can be imposed is whichever is
the greater of £18 million or 10% of the person’s ‘qualifying worldwide revenue’. (The
same maximum penalty applies if two entities are jointly and severally liable for a
penalty: see clause 86(1). “Qualifying worldwide revenue” has the same meaning as
regulations made under clause 85(14) in its application to a group of entities: see
clause 86(7)).
This power allows the Secretary of State to make regulations defining ‘qualifying
worldwide revenue’.
Justification for the power

‘Qualifying worldwide revenue’ is central to the regulatory framework’s enforcement
processes because it will be used to determine applicable penalties against services
(including groups of entities under clause 86 as applicable - which provides that
regulations defining the term can include the application of that term to a group of
entities). It is vital therefore that the definition is fit for purpose and easily understood
by industry and stakeholders. Through defining the terms in regulations, the
government will be able to draw on OFCOM’s financial expertise and resources, and
consider the approach taken in OFCOM’s other regulated sectors. OFCOM will also
be able to relay views from industry following a period of consultation.
Defining the terms in regulations will also allow for the definitions to be amended in
the future. Flexibility is required to ensure ‘’qualifying worldwide revenue’’ remains
usable by OFCOM and to enable easy reporting by industry.
This is a limited, technical power to set the meaning of the term. OFCOM’s powers to
use the term ‘qualifying worldwide revenue’ in practice will be clearly set out in the
legislation (in terms of calculating fees and setting penalties).
In determining the amount of a penalty to be imposed on a person, OFCOM must, in
particular, take into account—
○ any representations made, and evidence provided, by the person;
○ any steps taken by the person towards—
■ complying with any duty or requirement specified in the provisional
notice of enforcement action given to the person under clause 80, or
the confirmation decision given to the person under clause 83,
■ or remedying the failure to comply with any such duty or requirement;
and
○ the effects of the failure (or failures) in respect of which the penalty is
imposed.
The penalty must also be of an amount that OFCOM considers to be appropriate, and
proportionate to the failure (or failures) in respect of which it is imposed.
Justification for the procedure

The Secretary of State must consult OFCOM before making regulations under
subsection (14).
The affirmative procedure ensures that Parliament has full scrutiny and oversight of
the parameters of ‘qualifying worldwide revenue’, which will have a crucial role in
determining the value of the penalties which OFCOM will be able to impose under the
new regime.
Clause 97(1): Guidance about enforcement action

Power conferred on: OFCOM
Power exercised by: Guidance
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

A range of enforcement powers will be conferred on OFCOM in order to enable it to
tackle infringements in a proportionate and effective manner. Early engagement
between the regulator and individual service providers is a key emphasis of these
powers.
The enforcement provisions enable OFCOM to issue a provisional notice of
enforcement action in respect of a failure to comply with a number of listed duties or
requirements (see clause 82). In order to issue such a notice, OFCOM must consider
that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the provider has failed or is failing
to comply with a relevant duty or requirement. This notice can then be followed by a
confirmation decision requiring the provider to take remedial action as well as
imposing a penalty for continued failure to comply with the duties or requirements.
Maximum penalties of £18 million or 10% of qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever
is greater, alongside business disruption measures, are available to provide a suitable
deterrent or sanction.
OFCOM will be required to produce and publish guidance about how it proposes to
exercise its enforcement powers. The guidance must, in particular, give information
about the factors that OFCOM would consider it appropriate to take into account
when taking, or considering taking, enforcement action against regulated providers’
failure to comply with enforceable requirements. These enforceable requirements are
listed in clause 82 and include, for example, the safety duties to carry out and report
risk assessments, safety duties about illegal content or protecting adults and children,
user reporting and redress duties, recording-keeping and review duties.
In relation to any enforcement action by OFCOM which relates to a failure by a
provider of a regulated service to comply with the safety duties on illegal content and
protecting children, the guidance must explain how OFCOM will take into account the
impact (or possible impact) of such a failure on children.
Before producing such guidance, OFCOM must consult with the Secretary of State
and any other person OFCOM considers appropriate. OFCOM will have the power to
amend or revise the guidance.
Justification for the power

Since this guidance will be informing regulated service providers how OFCOM
proposes to exercise its enforcement powers under the Bill, it is appropriate for the
regulator to be responsible for such guidance after consulting the Secretary of State
and other persons who OFCOM consider appropriate.
Such guidance is too detailed to be set out on the face of the legislation. Further, the
power to revise the guidance provides OFCOM with the flexibility to modify the details
if they are required in light of emerging technologies and changes in the activities of
regulated services.
Justification for the procedure

Since these provisions are concerned with operational and administrative matters in
the context of how the regulator intends to use its enforcement powers, the provision
to be made is administrative rather than legislative in character. Therefore, no
Parliamentary procedure is considered necessary.
