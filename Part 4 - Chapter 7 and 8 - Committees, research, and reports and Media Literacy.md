commercially sensitive.
Subsection (5) sets out that this clause applies to reports about the use of
technology under clause 69; transparency reports under clause 100; reports about
researchers’ access to information under clause 101; and reports under this clause.
Chapter 8: Media literacy

Clause 103: Media Literacy

This clause will replace section 11 of the Communications Act 2003, which
contains the existing duty on OFCOM to promote media literacy in relation to
broadcasting and electronic media. The replacement clause expands and
strengthens the existing duty, and applies the duty in relation to online safety.
New subsection (1) provides that OFCOM must take action to improve the
media literacy of UK users and encourage regulated service providers and
broadcasters to use and develop tools which can improve people’s digital media
literacy. This includes technologies and systems which help users to identify what
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)

type of material they are seeing (for example sponsored content), how reliable and
accurate content it is, and how users can control the material they receive.
New subsection (3) specifies that in performing its duty, OFCOM must deliver,
commission, or encourage education initiatives aimed at improving media literacy
rates for UK citizens. This is a new requirement and could include, for example,
public awareness campaigns or providing training to improve the skills of teachers.
New subsection (4) requires OFCOM to issue guidance on how to evaluate
media literacy initiatives and actions. The aim of the guidance is to help improve the
quality of evaluations of media literacy initiatives, and to improve overall
understanding of what efforts are effective in building long-term media literacy
understanding in individuals.
New subsection (8) specifies that OFCOM’s annual report must contain a
summary of the steps that they have taken to fulfil their expanded duty to promote
media literacy in relation to the relevant financial year.

#### DELEGATED POWERS MEMORANDUM

CHAPTER 7: COMMITTEES, RESEARCH AND REPORTS
Clause 101(8): OFCOM’s report about researchers’ access to information

Power conferred on: OFCOM
Power exercised by: Guidance
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

Under this clause, OFCOM must prepare a report on the manner and extent to which
independent researchers are currently able to obtain information from providers of
regulated services to inform their research into online safety matters; the legal and
other issues which currently constrain the sharing of information for such purposes;
and the extent to which greater access to information for such purposes might be
achieved.
In this clause, a person carries out “independent research” if the person carries out
research on behalf of a person other than a provider of a regulated service.
In preparing the report, OFCOM must consult the Information Commissioner, the
Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, United Kingdom Research and Innovation,
persons who appear to OFCOM to have relevant expertise, persons representing
providers of regulated services as well as other persons OFCOM considers
appropriate. OFCOM must then publish the report within the period of two years
beginning with the day on which this clause comes into force, and send a copy of the
report to the Secretary of State, who must lay it before Parliament.
Ongoing research and analysis into online safety matters is essential in preventing
future harm to users. Following the publication of that report, this clause then provides
OFCOM with a delegated power to produce guidance about matters dealt with in the
report for providers of regulated services and persons carrying out independent
research into online safety matters.
This guidance will support providers of regulated services and persons carrying out
independent research in interpreting OFCOM’s report and applying its findings. This
power is a limited power with the steps that OFCOM must take to produce a report
and any subsequent guidance both clearly established in primary legislation.
Following the publication of the report, if OFCOM decides to prepare such guidance,
it must consult the same list of persons suggested for consultation when preparing
the report.
OFCOM must also publish the guidance (and any revised guidance) and include in
each transparency report under clause 100 an assessment of the effectiveness of the
guidance. The requirement that OFCOM includes an assessment of the effectiveness
of its guidance in its transparency report will ensure that the efficacy of this power is
under public review.
Justification for the power

It is appropriate for these matters to be set out in guidance as opposed to in primary
or secondary legislation because they are not legislative in character. The guidance
that OFCOM may produce would be non-binding on companies.
Justification for the procedure

This is a discretionary power to produce guidance. The guidance that OFCOM may
produce would be non-binding on companies. This guidance will deal with operational
and administrative matters and so we do not consider it necessary or appropriate for
Parliament to consider. Its publication will ensure that the guidance is available to the
public and no further procedural requirements are needed.
CHAPTER 8: MEDIA LITERACY
Clause 103(4): Media literacy

Power conferred on: OFCOM
Power exercised by: Guidance
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

OFCOM’s existing media literacy duties in Section 11 of the Communications Act
2003 will be replaced with the broader provisions set out in clause 103. This will
extend these duties into the online sphere and expand upon them. The new provision
will require OFCOM to take steps to improve the media literacy of members of the
public and, in relation to material published by means of the electronic media such as
online, TV and radio, to encourage the development and use of technologies and
systems that help to improve the media literacy of members of the public.
The Bill will contain a new, detailed definition of ‘media literacy’ which includes an
understanding of the nature and characteristics of material published by means of the
electronic media, and an awareness of the impact that such material may have (for
example the impact on the behaviour of those who receive it). It also covers an
awareness of the available systems by which the nature of such material, and its
reliability and accuracy, may be established, and personal information may be
protected.
Under clause 11(4), OFCOM will be required to prepare guidance about the
evaluation of educational initiatives, action taken by service providers, and emerging
technologies and processes designed to improve the media literacy of the public.
Under clauses 11(5) and (6) OFCOM must publish this guidance and keep it under
review.
Justification for the power

Currently there is limited robust evaluation of the effectiveness of media literacy
provisions at improving media literacy capabilities in individuals across organisations
undertaking media literacy activity. As such there is an evidence gap about what
types of media literacy activity are effective in building long-term media literacy
capabilities in individuals. The guidance OFCOM is required to issue on evaluations is
intended to help organisations delivering media literacy activity to better evaluate the
effectiveness of their measures.
It is not possible to set out details about this guidance on the face of this legislation as
further research is required to understand what the exact content or nature of the
guidance should look like. Researching and exploring this further will be a role for
OFCOM to undertake as it produces the guidance.
Justification for the procedure

OFCOM will publish the guidance. The provision is administrative rather than
legislative in character, and no parliamentary procedure is considered necessary.
