#### EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR THIS SECTION

Part 5: Appeals and Super-complaints
Chapter 1: Appeals

Clause 104: Appeals against OFCOM decisions relating to the register under section 59

This clause allows for appeals against OFCOM’s decisions about the
inclusion and removal of services from the register of Category 1, Category 2A, and
Category 2B services. OFCOM must establish the register and service providers
become subject to additional duties with regard to any Category 1, Category 2A, and
Category 2B services they provide, by virtue of the service and service provider’s
inclusion on the relevant part of the register.
Subsection (1) allows for appeals to be made in the following circumstances:
a. After OFCOM decides to include a regulated service in the register. This route
of appeal may be used when a service is first added to the register, or moved
between categories, or when OFCOM reassesses services following the
setting of new threshold conditions through regulations.
b. After OFCOM decides not to remove a regulated service from the register (or
relevant part of the register). This route of appeal may be used when a
service has been on a relevant part of the register, but the provider of that
service no longer considers the service to meet the threshold conditions to
merit being on the register, or that part of it.
Subsection (2) establishes that the route of appeal against such decisions lies
by way of an appeal to the Upper Tribunal. It also makes clear that only the provider
of a service included on the register can make an appeal.
Subsection (3) states that where a provider appeals a decision to be included
in the relevant sections of the register, any “special requirements” need not be
complied with until the appeal is concluded. Under subsection (4), these “special
requirements” are defined as any additional requirements that would be placed on
the relevant providers if the service they provided was added to the relevant sections
of the register. Note that this only applies to the first type of appeal specified above.
Service providers will need to comply with “special requirements” while an appeal
against an OFCOM decision not to remove a regulated service from the register (or
relevant part of the register) is ongoing.
Subsection (5) provides that the Upper Tribunal must decide the appeal on
the same principles that apply on an application for judicial review - meaning that the
tribunal will assess the legality, fairness and rationality of the decision and the
fairness of the procedure used to make it, rather than conducting a review of the
merits of a decision.
Subsection (6) states that the Upper Tribunal may either dismiss the
provider’s appeal or quash OFCOM’s decision.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Should the Tribunal quash the decision then subsection (7) provides that the
Tribunal must remit the decision back to OFCOM, with any directions that the
Tribunal thinks are appropriate.
Clause 105: Appeals against OFCOM notices

This clause establishes routes of appeal against other decisions made by
OFCOM; in particular, the decision to give a Use of Technology Notice, a
confirmation decision, or penalty notice.
Subsection (1) allows a person who is given a Use Of Technology Notice to
appeal against OFCOM’s decision to issue one against them pursuant to clauses 64,
65 and 67.
Subsection (2) allows for any person who has been the subject of an
enforcement decision to appeal against OFCOM’s decision to issue:
a. confirmation decisions (as set out in clause 83); and
b. penalty notices (as set out in clauses 84, 89 and 90).
In addition, the Upper Tribunal may give permission to other parties who have not
been given the confirmation decision or penalty notice to appeal an OFCOM
decision, as long as they are judged to have sufficient interest in that original
decision: subsection (3). For example, this could be a civil society group rather than
the provider themselves.
In all of the above cases, appeals would be by way of an appeal to the Upper
Tribunal.
Subsection (4) states that, again, the Upper Tribunal must decide these
appeals applying the same principles as for judicial review - as explained in the notes
for clause 104.
Subsection (5) states that the Upper Tribunal may either dismiss the appeal
or quash OFCOM’s decision. Should the Tribunal quash the decision then subsection
(6) provides that the Tribunal must remit the decision back to OFCOM for
reconsideration, with any directions that the Tribunal thinks are appropriate.
Subsection (7) cross-references to the instances when penalty notices might
be issued.
Chapter 2: Super-complaints

Clause 106: Power to make super-complaints

This clause establishes a super-complaints procedure whereby a body
representing the interests of UK users of regulated services, or members of the
public can make a super-complaint to OFCOM about any feature of one or more
regulated services, or the conduct of one or more providers of such services.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (1) sets out that a super-complaint may be made about any
particular feature of one or more regulated services, or the conduct of one or more
providers of such services, or a combination of the two where there appears to be or
where there is material risk of:
a. causing significant harm to users of the services, members of the public or a
particular group of users / members of the public;
b. significantly adversely affecting the rights to freedom of expression to users of
the service, members of the public or a particular group of users / members of
the public;
c. causing significant unwarranted infringements of privacy to users of the
services, members of the public or a particular group of users / members of
the public; or
d. otherwise having a significant adverse impact on users of the services,
members of the public or a particular group of users / members of the public.
Subsection (2) provides that an “eligible entity” can bring such a complaint.
OFCOM may only consider a super-complaint that relates to the conduct of a single
regulated service or single provider of one or more regulated services, if OFCOM
believes that the complaint is of particular importance or it relates to impacts on a
particularly large number of people (be they users of that service or members of the
public).
To be eligible, the entity must meet criteria which will be specified in
regulations made by the Secretary of State: see subsection (3). One of the criteria
which must be specified in the regulations is that the entity is a body representing the
interests of users of regulated services, or members of the public or a particular
group of such users or members of the public: see subsection (4). Before making
these regulations, the Secretary of State must consult OFCOM and such other
persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate: see subsection (5).
Subsection (6) defines conduct as that which includes acts and omissions,
and “user” is defined as any UK user.
Clause 107: Super-complaints: procedure

Subsection (1) gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations
which would set out the procedural aspects of the complaints made under clause
Subsection (2) provides examples of the type of matters that these
regulations may include; such as, requiring an eligible entity to provide notification to
OFCOM of an intention to make a super-complaint. The regulations may also include
the form and manner of such a complaint (including requirements for supporting
evidence), how OFCOM must respond to such a complaint, and time limits (or
provisions for determining the time limits) for carrying out the relevant steps in
relation to a complaint.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Subsection (3) sets out the consultation requirements for the above
regulation. The Secretary of State must consult OFCOM and any other persons they
consider appropriate.
Clause 108: Super-complaints: guidance

This clause puts a requirement on OFCOM to produce and publish guidance
on super-complaints.
As per subsection (1), this guidance, must include:
a. Guidance about the criteria for entities eligible to make such complaints;
b. Guidance about procedural matters relating to such complaints such as the
quality or type of evidence required as part of a super-complaint; for example,
evidence of harm to users or members of the public and evidence of non-
compliance with the relevant duties in the Online Safety Bill; and
c. Guidance about any other aspect of such complaints that OFCOM considers
it appropriate to include.
Subsection (2) provides a requirement for OFCOM to publish the guidance,
including guidance that is revised or replaced.

#### DELEGATED POWERS MEMORANDUM

PART 5: APPEALS AND SUPER-COMPLAINTS
CHAPTER 2: SUPER-COMPLAINTS
Clause 106(3): Power to make super-complaints

Power conferred on: Secretary of State
Power exercised by: Regulations
Parliamentary procedure: Affirmative

Context and purpose

This clause will establish a super-complaints procedure whereby an “eligible entity”
can make a complaint to OFCOM about any feature of one or more regulated
services or the conduct of one or more providers of such services.
Subsection (3) will provide that to be eligible to bring a complaint, an entity must meet
criteria which will be specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State. One of
the criteria which must be specified in the regulations is that the entity is a body
representing the interests of users of regulated services, or members of the public or
a particular group of such users or members of the public: see subsection (4). Before
making these regulations, the Secretary of State must consult OFCOM and such
other persons as they consider appropriate: see subsection (5).
Justification for the power

This power allows the Secretary of State to determine the criteria for entities who are
able to make a super-complaint. OFCOM will then determine whether an entity that
has made a complaint is eligible by assessing it against the criteria set out by the
Secretary of State in the regulations. This protects the independence of the regulator
while providing proportionate oversight of the parameters of the super-complaints
process.
The Bill sets out clear parameters for the super-complaints procedure, and setting
further details on the criteria for entities who are able to make a super-complaint in
regulations will not only ensure that they can adapt over time, but also enables the
Secretary of State to consult where appropriate.
There are clear limitations on the Secretary of State’s powers to make regulations
under this power, and the Secretary of State must consult OFCOM, and such other
persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.
Justification for the procedure

We consider it appropriate that regulations under this section are subject to the
affirmative procedure because they will determine who can make a super-complaint
and could therefore have a significant effect on the scope of the super-complaints
scheme as well as the burdens placed on OFCOM.
Clause 107(1): Super-complaints: procedure

Power conferred on: Secretary of State
Power exercised by: Regulations
Parliamentary procedure: Negative

Context and purpose

The super-complaints process is a central part of the regulatory framework. It is
essential that it is effective and proportionate, and that it can operate without
imposing an undue burden on the regulator.
This section allows the Secretary of State to make regulations containing provision
about procedural matters relating to super-complaints under clause 106. Such
regulations may, in particular, include provisions about how an eligible entity can
notify OFCOM of its intention to make a complaint, the form and manner of such a
complaint, how OFCOM must respond to such a complaint and the time limits for
such a response.
Justification for the power

Setting out the procedure for super-complaints in secondary legislation will ensure
that the process can be revised and updated when the regulatory framework is in
force, so that the process can be improved upon and updated as needed. As the
procedure for making a super-complaint is an administrative procedure, it is
considered an appropriate matter for secondary legislation.
Justification for the procedure

The regulations under clause 107 will be subject to the negative procedure. We
consider this procedure gives Parliament appropriate oversight given that this power
concerns the making of provisions relating to procedural matters. Furthermore, before
making regulations under subsection (1), the Secretary of State must consult
OFCOM, and such other persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.
This will ensure the procedural matters being proposed are fit for purpose.
Clause 108(1): Super-complaints: guidance

Power conferred on: OFCOM
Power exercised by: Statutory Guidance
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

This clause confers a duty on OFCOM to issue guidance about complaints under
clause 106.
This must include guidance about the criteria specified in regulations under clause
106(3), and guidance about procedural matters relating to super-complaints under
clause 107.
Justification for the power

As OFCOM will be required to implement the regulations set out by the Secretary of
State under clause 106(3) and clause 107(1), OFCOM will be best placed to issue
guidance on these matters. We could expect this guidance to include further details
on the quality or type of evidence of harm required from a super-complaint, or further
detail on how a super-complaint should be structured.
Delegating this power to OFCOM will ensure that the guidance is responsive to
procedural changes and that it remains an instructive resource for entities that wish to
make super-complaints. It is important to ensure that guidance can be updated and
adapted if the criteria for entities who are able to make a super-complaint or the
provisions relating to procedural matters set out by the Secretary of State change.
Justification for the procedure

OFCOM must publish the guidance (and any revised or replacement guidance).
Given that this guidance will relate to operational and administrative matters, we do
not consider that a Parliamentary procedure is appropriate.
