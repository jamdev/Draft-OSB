#### DELEGATED POWERS MEMORANDUM

SCHEDULE 4: CATEGORIES OF REGULATED SERVICES: REGULATIONS
Power conferred on: Secretary of State
Power exercised by: Regulations
Parliamentary procedure: Negative

Context and purpose

The Bill creates different categories of regulated services which will have additional
duties imposed upon them. OFCOM will be under a duty to establish and maintain a
register of these particular categories of regulated services with one part for each of
the following (see clauses 59 and 60):
○ user-to-user services meeting the Category 1 threshold conditions;
○ search services meeting the Category 2A threshold conditions;
○ user-to-user services meeting the Category 2B threshold conditions.
Schedule 4 requires the Secretary of State to make regulations to specify the
threshold conditions that a regulated service must meet to be included in the relevant
part of the register.
Paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 4 requires the Secretary of State to specify, through
regulations, the precise conditions relating to a service’s number of users and
functionalities that must be met in order for a regulated service to be designated as a
“Category 1 service”. In making these regulations, the Secretary of State must take
into account the likely impact of the number of users of a service, and its
functionalities, on the level of risk of harm to adults from content that is harmful to
adults disseminated by means of the service.
In practice this means that those regulated user-to-user services with the largest
audiences and high-risk features will be designated as “Category 1 services" and
therefore providers of such a service will be subject to additional duties in respect of
content that is harmful to adults on their service. These include, for example, the duty
to assess and identify content that is harmful to adults on their service, a duty to
specify, in a clear and accessible way, in their terms of service how such content is to
be dealt with by the service provider and to produce for OFCOM annual transparency
reports. Category 1 service providers will also have duties to protect journalistic
content and content of democratic importance.
Paragraph 1(2) requires the Secretary of State to specify, through regulations, the
precise conditions relating to a search service’s number of users and any other
factors the Secretary of State considers relevant that must be met in order for a
regulated search service to be designated as a “Category 2A service”. Similarly,
paragraph 1(3) requires the Secretary of State to make regulations specifying the
conditions (in relation to the service’s number of users, functionalities and any other
factors the Secretary of State considers relevant) that must be met for a regulated
user-to-user service to be designated as a “Category 2B service”. Category 2A and
2B services will be under the additional duty to prepare annual transparency reports
for OFCOM. Such reports will include, for example, information about the steps the
service provider is taking in relation to illegal content on their services.
The regulations will also specify how a service may count as meeting the relevant
threshold conditions, such as by meeting the conditions in any specified combination.
However, this is subject to the rule that at least one specified condition about a
number of users and at least one condition about functionality must be met for
Category 1 and 2B services, and that at least one specified condition about number of
users must be met for Category 2A services: see paragraph 1(4).
Prior to making regulations in respect of Category 1 services, OFCOM must carry out
research into how the number of United Kingdom users of user-to-user services, and
the functionalities offered by user-to-user services, affect the dissemination of content
that is harmful to adults on those services (paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 4). Before
making regulations in respect of Category 2A services, OFCOM must carry out
research into the prevalence of illegal content and content that is harmful to children
presented via the search service, the numbers of users of such services and such
other factors as it considers relevant to the Category 2A threshold conditions. Before
specifying Category 2B threshold conditions via regulations, OFCOM must carry out
research into the dissemination of illegal content and content that is harmful to
children and adults via regulated user-to-user services, the number of users and
functionalities of user-to-user services and any other factors that OFCOM considers
relevant to the specifying of Category 2B threshold conditions.
OFCOM must then provide advice to the Secretary of State, based on its research.
This advice must make a recommendation on the provisions to be made through the
regulations (paragraph 2(5) to Schedule 4), and must be published. In respect of
Category 2A and 2B threshold conditions, such advice may include advice that the
regulations should include another factor in addition to number of users (and
functionalities for Category 2A), and what that other factor should be. Although the
Secretary of State does not have to follow this advice, this research period will ensure
that the Secretary of State has evidence and justification to inform the making of
regulations.
The Secretary of State must then make regulations. If the regulations include
provision which differs in any material respect from the provisions advised by
OFCOM, the Secretary of State must publish a statement explaining why they have
departed from that advice (paragraph 2(8) to Schedule 4).
After the regulations are made, OFCOM will be required to assess services which it
considers are likely to meet the Category 1, 2A or 2B threshold conditions set out in
the regulations against those threshold conditions, and to establish a register of
Category 1, 2A and 2B services (see clause 59). Services become subject to
Category 1, 2A or 2B duties by virtue of being added to the relevant part of the
register established under clause 59.
The regulations may be amended or replaced by further regulations but no
amendment or replacement regulations can be made until OFCOM has carried out
further research and provided advice to the Secretary of State based on its research.
Such research may be initiated by OFCOM, or by the Secretary of State (paragraph
3(4) to Schedule 4). After regulations are amended or replaced, OFCOM will have to
assess services which it considers are likely to meet the new Category 1, 2A or 2B
threshold conditions against the new threshold conditions, and to make any
necessary changes to the register (subsections (1), (2) and (3) of clause 60).
Justification for the power

This power is central to establishing the regulatory regime. The differentiated
approach - which places additional duties on the highest-risk services - is essential to
making the regime effective and proportionate. Only providers of services which meet
the Category 1 threshold conditions will be subject to additional duties around legal
content which is harmful to adults, transparency reporting, and journalistic
protections. Likewise, only those services which meet the Category 2A and 2B
threshold conditions will be so designated and their providers subject to the additional
duty on transparency reporting.
Setting thresholds in primary legislation could quickly become outdated. This could,
for example, result in high-reach, high-risk services remaining free of Category 1
regulatory duties - which would negatively impact the effectiveness of the new
regime. Conversely, it could result in low-reach and/or low-risk services remaining
subject to Category 1 regulatory duties unduly - which would create disproportionate
regulatory burdens.
Setting the threshold conditions through secondary legislation will deliver increased
flexibility and ensure the process is responsive to technological change, changes in
people’s use of regulated services, and trends related to online harms as well as
responsive to the service it regulates. As technologies and user-patterns change, it is
essential that the thresholds for the categories of services can be modified and added
to.
Furthermore, the government considers it essential for the setting of threshold
conditions to be informed by independent evidence and advice. That is why
regulations can only be made after OFCOM has provided the Secretary of State with
research and advice.
Numerous safeguards have been built in to ensure this power is used fairly,
transparently and proportionately. Specifically:
○ the power can only be exercised - both for the first making of regulations and
future amendments or replacements - after OFCOM has provided research
and advice to the Secretary of State (paragraph 2(11) and sub-paragraphs
(1), (2) and (3) or paragraph 3 of Schedule 4).
○ This research and advice will be published, subject to confidentiality
requirements (paragraphs 2(7), 3(7) and 4 of Schedule 4).
○ The Secretary of State will be required to publish a statement if they make,
amend or replace regulations which differ materially from OFCOM’s advice,
or if they decide not to amend or replace regulations in spite of advice from
OFCOM to do so (paragraph 2(8), 3(8) and (9) of Schedule 4). Such a
statement must be published no later than the time at which the regulations
to which the statement relates are made, and in such manner as the
Secretary of State considers appropriate for bringing it to the attention of
persons who may be affected by it (paragraph 2(9), and sub-paragraphs (10)
and (11) of paragraph 3 of Schedule 4).
Given the fast-moving technological landscape in which the threshold conditions will
be set, it appears sensible to specify such conditions in secondary legislation. The Bill
also includes various safeguards pertaining to the use of regulations to set threshold
conditions, in order to provide transparency regarding the decision-making process, in
particular where there is any departure from OFCOM’s advice.
Justification for the procedure

By virtue of clause 132(5)(f), regulations made under paragraph 1 of Schedule 4 are
subject to the negative procedure.
The negative procedure is considered appropriate because, as described above,
there are significant safeguards built into the regulation-making process in Schedule 4
of the Bill. Furthermore, use of the negative procedure will ensure that the register of
Category 1, 2A and 2B services can be established swiftly following provision of
research and advice by OFCOM, whilst also allowing for appropriate Parliamentary
scrutiny of the regulations. This is important to balance giving service providers
certainty and clarity, and enabling rapid changes if new, high-risk functionalities
emerge, with the need for effective Parliamentary oversight.
